The first lunar calendar, dated to 32,000 BC was discovered, drawn on animal bone in caves. It's believed hunters during the last Ice Age used these portable lunar calendars to anticipate the behavior of different animals like Mammoths. Since then, our Moon has been imprinted across all our ancient and modern cultures, even becoming the system from which our Gregorian calendar evolved from. In the present day, investors in crypto have used the Moon symbolically. \n\nWhat does it mean for all of us in crypto to be so ahead of our time, all while using the same metaphor of the Moon for the various measures of success and individual goals we collectively share in crypto? And how will the future appreciate our ambitions and perseverance within the present moment's growing pains on our way to mass adoption? These are some of the questions that Gazers ask.\n\nOn the surface, Gazers function as a lunar calendar, algorithmically synching closely with Moon phases in the sky, joining the blockchain with one of humanity's longest running lineages in art. Gazers seeks to create a community of collectors celebrating the change of our perceptions that happen over time, our collective goals in crypto, and our love of color theory, astronomy, and generative art. \n\nWhat we are building in blockchain and NFTs will primarily be for the benefit of the future. As such, this artwork was designed to pace itself and speed up its frame rate over time, scaling into anticipated advancements in technology that will steadily allow the artwork to run at faster speeds while at larger scales. Each NFT starts out with the assignment of a date from the past 20 years. These dates correspond to events that happened under particular New Moons that shaped my path as an artist. This is the Origin Moon trait and how Gazers is in part a conceptual self portrait. \n\nStarting from the Origin Moon, each New Moon that arrives will speed up the potential animation of the NFT. For example, an NFT with a 20 year old Origin Moon might run at 20 frames per second, appearing as an animation. But one with an Origin Moon fresh from the sale will run closer to 1 frame per second, appearing more like a slowly evolving painting. Every moment, the frame rate of the artwork speeds up fractionally, indecipherable to our eyes. Stacking these advancements over time creates a generational evolution of experience. There is something undeniably beautiful about everything speeding up within our lifetimes, but the Moon, high above us, continues to carry on at the same meandering rate of 29.53 days in each cycle. Much like these blockchain technologies and NFT markets, this artwork was designed to be collected by the present, but appreciated in a greater sense than we can even imagine by the future. \n\nI created Gazers to be like a living artwork, to be lived with, and to not only have the artwork evolve over time but also the appreciation and experience of viewers. As I coded the work, I imagined it hanging on the wall of collectors, a fixture in their physical space. Collectors might spend a moment admiring their work, walk away for a couple hours, and then come back to be delighted, noticing the most subtle of shifts. Each layer of the work consists of pattern designs. With the passage of time, the thickness of the layered lines pulse and the direction a design moves will advance or rotate, changing our perception of color in the most subtle and optical of ways. Each day at midnight, each layer receives a new set of rules in terms of how to rise or shine over the next 24 hours. The result is color that rises and sets, echoing the change of light in our sky.\n\nMy use of color has consistently been what I've been best known for across my 20 year artistic career. In all my work until now, I've made all the color and design choices as I've painted as a human in the moment. But in Gazers, I designed a complex system around color theory as I understand it, joining my talent for coding with my vision for color. \n\nMany NFT collectors of my work might be familiar with the additional experiences some of their NFTs unlock at my website. Rather than use a Gazers NFT to unlock a website, I decided this time to create rendering modes that unlock within the code over time. These additional modes of viewing are intended to help a collector better understand the architecture of their artwork's design and also benefit from greater enjoyment of it. The addition of these experiences should present an additional benefit to HODLing for some. \n\nEvery 29 and a half days, we reach a Moon phase called the New Moon. This is when the dark side of the Moon is fully visible and no sunlight is reflected from the lunar surface back to Earth. In Gazers, each New Moon phase creates a New Moon design. In this artwork, the hash seed creates color theory and design rules. These rules are deterministic and dictate all the moons that will generatively be created into infinity. Time reveals our moons. Pairing time with deterministic generative code creates the ephemeral moment. We can all agree that looking at the Moon in the sky never seems to be the exact same experience twice, nor the exact same from different locations. I wanted to echo this nature in Gazers and emphasize the urgency and rarity of our present moment and how an artwork can capture this. \n\nAs individuals, we all have our own version of the Moon and what reaching it means. Just as our goals change over time, often subtly, sometimes dramatically, so will our moons, creating a visual representation that might coincide with what's changing inside of us. In crypto, we are all ahead of our time. We are all gazers. And we are all waiting for our next Moon.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pepqUFeetYERaIb1kC9AtXGwvHDQ27ejxY4Y3rrWGh_N9WVepMRe6vBcm-DbMpJxoAfys3Rjb74INOvHl3BQ7f_uXF9_qvqy2A"},

It is painting new patterns on the fly in between macro and micro compositions with a duality of different rhythms and continuous synchronicity. The focus is alternately drawn to detail, then distracted by movement elsewhere and caught up in the overall picture. This rhythm turns the visual complexity into an active experience.\n\nASDF: “My work should offer individual ways of interpretation, or even allow one to find some self in it. It wants to inspire some thoughts about dynamics and systemics and also just mesmerize the audience, capture them in a little fantasy, or just for a brief moment in a state of satisfaction.”\n\nCargo is the latest work in Kim Asendorf’s ongoing work series of pixel pattern animations. Starting with [monogrid](https://monogrid.xyz) in 2021, and [Sabotage](https://sabotage.kim) in 2022, both highly conceptual series, therefore visually very raw and unimaginable. Asendorf discovered various interesting details in these works, which eventually became fundamental in his artistic expression.\n\nCargo is a real time WebGL software written in JavaScript and GLSL. At its core is a flip-flop render buffer, also known as feedback buffer. That means the animation is alternately rendered in two different frame buffers. This technique allows the usage of the previous frame of the animation as an asset in the current rendering, which allows for a series of reactive animation strategies.\n\nAn initial image with variable structures and patterns is rendered and subsequently loaded into the frame buffer. A fragment shader is used to apply a set of animation algorithms that make the pixel move and a set of reset algorithms that constantly try to recreate the initial image. The final animation happens in selected containers and is always a combination of two algorithms, one from each set. By regularly animating and partially resetting the pixels, a wide range of movement patterns appear.\n\nCargo is a responsive and pixel exact artwork and it will fill the screen on any display size, thus changing the total amount of used pixels accordingly. This results in the fact that the detail level in the artwork is changing depending on the dimensions. The overall structure is consistently stretching the x and y axis independently. Single containers scale along the dimensions and offer more pixels to render the patterns at a larger representation compared to a smaller representation. This behavior leads to a brilliance, perfect pixels, a crisp rendering with nothing like compression artifacts.\n\nThis software includes the [simplex noise](https://github.com/jwagner/simplex-noise.js) JavaScript implementation by Jonas Wagner and the [cellular noise](https://github.com/stegu/webgl-noise) GLSL code by Stefan Gustavson.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YStoMZzvSrc9jrbZwj3d84GAiyqVTwsJLehjLTC_VP7RTs1Is6euMyF0KN8k-JDuJAxfLLf-95Klwi45sZjHnGTL--jtvQp3Il0"},

Snowfro) has been intrigued by the idea of representing digital artwork in the physical world in the form of an ephemeral physical object with meaning, but with no inherent value. \n\nDonald Judd has long been an inspiration for Art Blocks. One aspect we admire most about Judd’s artistic practice is the elegance of design he effortlessly paired with the accessibility of materials that could be found at a hardware store. With Judd as inspiration, we hatched a plan to create a unique generative art friendship bracelet that includes instructions to make, in minutes, a simple bracelet using a few dollars’ worth of embroidery floss. Donald Judd believed that what surrounds us in our day-to-day life is already so beautiful, and that ultimately the experience of creating art is as important as owning it.\n\nErick was incredibly excited to collaborate with renowned artist Alexis André (a.k.a. MacTuitui) to bring generative art and ephemeral physical objects together in the form of friendship bracelets. Conceptualized by Erick and aesthetically and programmatically designed by Alexis, this project pairs creative coding with a beautiful spectrum of embroidery floss colors. The project was a true team effort, as each member of the Art Blocks team designed and named their own color palette!\n\nThe project is a token of our appreciation to the creators, makers, builders, and collectors who have all contributed to making the Art Blocks community what it is today. Participating in this project is a signal, both online and IRL, that you’re a participant in this evolution of art + community. You are pushing the best ideas forward. You are the reason all of these imaginative projects come to life. Our community is what makes all of this possible. So, to say it plainly, we appreciate you, and we hope that you’ll accept this bracelet as a token of our special friendship!\n\nThe owner of any wallet with an Art Blocks piece at the time of snapshot (October 26, 2022, at 3pm US Central time) is eligible to claim two mints from this special generative art project. We would love to see you keep one bracelet and share your love for generative art by gifting your second mint! These mints are free to claim (you pay only the gas) and exist on L1 Ethereum. Please note that we may in the future release additional modified iterations of the Friendship Bracelets project, ideally on an L2 scaling solution, that may substantially increase the total supply of tokens related to the project, with the intent of being a more accessible entry point to a larger audience. But this version is what we're here to celebrate today, and this gift is for you in gratitude for your support along the way. Please enjoy this token of our friendship and explore the wonderful artwork created by Alexis André. Then, let's all make bracelets together! \n\nWarmly,\nAlexis + Erick + the Art Blocks team\n\n\n\nThe claim window expires on January 10, 2023, at noon US Central time.\n\nClick into the Display Notes for information about making your bracelet.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/P3oEmfNNRGQgkLA1z3ya7NBdjlw_BXuStDPEoEzGiCcqykQlDh5wJgzOet2DE88cv8hNUTgA33DwO54O7mni1No_5alxHqY84-vy"},

After a millennia of slumber it must again usher its minions into the expanse. It must sustain. It must replenish. So it guides its horde out to the stars, visiting countless worlds to restart the cycle. For an eternity the cycle has repeated, minding and tending this garden of worlds. Now it is time for the garden to give back. This event has come to be known as *The Harvest*.\n\n*The Harvest* depicts worlds that exist in eternal symbiosis with the Caretaker. We witness the spectacle of monumental chromatic beams as they impact the surface of these beautiful, alien bodies. The Caretaker assigns different constellations to each planet, giving rise to unique combinations of beams as they extract the much needed nectar. This project has been inspired by a life-long fascination for science fiction and space exploration. Aiming to capture a moment of awe, the beams reach to their origin, emulating a cathedral-like atmosphere in the vein of Hugh Ferriss, while borrowing inspiration from Micheal Whelan’s landscapes. All in the effort of capturing a sense of how small we are in relation to the cosmos.\n\n*The Harvest* is built on p5js, and takes advantage of its 3d api. With the orthogonal view enabled, the algorithm uses volumetric rectangular units to create the stylised illusion of alien landscapes. Each beam has a position, color, reach and yield that is calculated and procedurally drawn over time.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/e66607aa87a89005b573e509f8fa1ab0.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

The first element within the sculpture, akin to a black hole, is a shape that defines itself through the surrounding characteristics it draws in. This halo of characteristics, like a beautifully radiant glass cover, symbolizes the constructed personality. Casting light on these black shapes, shielded by the identities they exhibit, the algorithm invites us to question our perceptions of those we encounter. How deeply do we truly know the people in our lives? It challenges us to consider if changing the perspective could alter our perception of them, while also offering the opportunity to simulate such a change with the help of animation. Perhaps the nature of our identities is as varied as the angles from which they are viewed?\n\nBlind Spots serves as a depiction of my mental journey, transforming abstract thought patterns into a solidified artifact in the medium of generative art. The narrative is inspired by the diverse ways in which we perceive each other, a theme born from countless personal encounters. From a technical standpoint, it steps into uncharted territory for me, being the first artwork to emphasize high-resolution printing capabilities while maintaining real-time animation, a central element in my artwork. It is also my first on-chain project, prompting a restructure of the previous workflows.\n\nVisually inspired by *Iittala - Kaleidoscope* exhibition, which displayed a mesmerizing interplay of glass sculptures and light, Blind Spots features a gradient backdrop punctuated by black shapes that undulate under the influence of a transmission shader, mimicking the iridescent shimmer of pearls. The geometry of the glass cover is crafted through the algorithmic movement of two curves revolving around each other. To produce high-resolution images suitable for printing, a bucket rendering technique with overscan was developed.\n\nArticulated through two elements within each portrait, Blind Spots presents a visual metaphor for a human. This duality also echoes our presence on social media — carefully crafted showcases projecting a polished persona while concealing the authentic self. Together, the elements form a unique character from every point of view.\n\n## Controls\n- [ click ] - toggle animation\n- [ s ] - save the current frame as an image\n\n## URL parameters (see display notes)\n- [ ?animate ] - animation on by default\n- [ ?fill ] - responsive version to fill the browse\n- [ ?width=x ] - render image with x width\n- [ ?print ] - enable high-resolution mode (eg. ?print&width=10000)\n- [ ?grainSamples=x ] - between 1 - 10\n- [ ?refractSamples=x ] - between 1 - 5", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/A9fyBvVH5eCauaHFhR5prBn66IOlU7ZCeV2gRfg859erwxTzr_GEgmHB2hcKwG6OJBxjT7Cr0ayhxmrsieQsiW637aVwrPNT-a4"},

Pictograms and hieroglyphics turned into paintings, which eventually became moving images and photoreal graphics. Spoken words evolved into written text, eventually becoming complex screenplays, computer code, and a world of hyperlinks. Most mediums are not discarded, but combined or extended to incorporate new technology or ideas. \n\nWhen a new medium comes into existence, the capabilities of both the artist and viewer increase. The potential subjects within said medium can grow in complexity as well, some fully dependent on the medium that holds them. Other subjects are timeless, popping in and out of multiple movements and genres throughout history. An example of the latter is still life. From ancient carvings through contemporary art, scenes of commonality, beauty, and metaphor have persisted. Traditionally viewed as a type of technical practice or meditation (the bottom of the “hierarchy of genres”), some examples of still life have gone on to be among the most important works in art history. \n\nChimera is a natural progression of still life. It is an old tradition in the very new medium of on-chain generative art, a movement that will have an enormous presence in the future. Chimera simultaneously reaches into the past while exploiting the capabilities of the present and seeks to represent a unique moment in time, a generation of art in between digital and physical realities, encapsulating where we came from and where we are going. \n\nNOTES:\n\nChimera is graphically intensive.

Bringing together choreography, code, blockchain, generative art, and cryptography, the work culminates in a live performance. Each output is driven by the motion data of its underlying unique, on-chain choreographic sequence. The sequences behind the first 100 minted works (mint #2 to #101) will be performed during the IRL premiere. The hosting art institution will be announced in 2023. \n\nA journey of slowly recovering the human unfolds as such: 1) reveal on Art Blocks, 2) uncover the choreographic score, and 3) final performance. After the reveal, the human is still unreadable, visible only through the results of movement on glass, obfuscated by code, rendered as a still image. In the next phase of the work, collectors get a glimpse at their underlying choreography by unlocking the secondary token—an on-chain choreographic score. In the final phase, the performance, life is breathed into the human movement that has been lying dormant inside the pieces. **Human Unreadable** brings flesh and viscerality into code and \"vulnerability as a feature\" into long-form generative art. What you don’t immediately see in the visual artwork outputs is the invisible potentiality of performance, inscripted on-chain and able to be brought to life by a dancer at any moment. \n\n **Human Unreadable** intentionally punctures the safety of modernist design and the idea of a universal voice, pushing the limits of human expression within rigid technical systems. With a focus on the body, the collection brings risk, chaos, confusion, and vulnerability to the reveal, everything that function-focused design systems normally prevent. Each piece is an invitation, a transparent layer through which the messy human experience can come into focus through the three phases of the work. This work is a continuation of the pivot away from modernism, clean lines, and the quietly gendered values therein, in favor of a more embodied and sensual approach to human-machine collaboration pioneered by early women in digital art. **Human Unreadable**'s 6 distinct looks derive from the core materiality of Operator’s Privacy Collection: glass, light, x-ray and the human body. The transparent and illuminating nature of these materials reveal what is below the surface.\n\nWhat are you revealing when you reveal?\n\n**Human Unreadable** has roots in various histories such as computational choreography (Analivia Cordeiro, Jeanne Beaman), Merce Cunningham's Chance Dance, and the Experiments in Art and Technology movement. With Ti’s extensive background as an HCI technologist and multimedia artist and Catherine’s background as a choreographer and performance artist, Operator architected a bespoke team, 25+ individuals ranging from specialized engineers to dancers, who embarked on a 9 month process to realize the work. Operator's on-chain generative choreography method is the technical backbone of **Human Unreadable**—the process and open source tooling for which will be made available via white paper in 2023.  \n\n\n***Additional Information***\n\n**First Minter Benefits** \nThe first 100 minted pieces (mint #2 to #101) from the collection will be performed in the IRL premiere in an art institution. \n-Mint #2 to #101 will be counted as the first 100 mints. Mint #0 and #1 are artist mints held by Operator.\n-Hosting art institution will be announced in 2023. \n-Additionally, Privacy Key 00 holders will have one of their collected Human Unreadable sequences performed.\n\n**Choreographic Score (secondary token)** \n-The secondary token will be released at the end of June 2023.\n-The secondary token is a choreographic score that represents the unique choreography that generated the output minted on Art Blocks. For this reason, the Art Blocks token and the secondary token are bound together and cannot be transferred separately.\n-The underlying choreographic score visible through the secondary token can be performed by a choreographer or dancer at the collector's discretion.\n\n**GPU Intensive Rendering / Live Preview** \nThis piece involves GPU intensive composition and rendering of programmatically drawn body parts, generative glass objects, x-ray shaders as well as motion paths. As a result the ‘live preview’ on your laptop or phone may look less detailed than the PNG on Art Blocks which is rendered by a high powered computer. Not to worry!\n\n**Official Token-gated Prints** \nHuman Unreadable collectors will be able to purchase Operator official, signed, token-gated prints (on hand-selected materials) of their collected piece(s).", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WhZdpCPxyUOU5HMBjf3WuLfXTUfqVGriBKuurI_cq_XbPUdp3CmpuBknVhQF1m3JP2ZaG7k6RElRjrLXHLklpKD6x3yyfc-rtA"},

For many centuries following the Schism, all seemed well; humanity moved on and some remnants of magic remained to aid in the rebuilding of society. \n\nBut all was not well. Something was growing along the edge of reality, eating away the Runiverse, bit by bit, a plague known as the Absence; a creeping fog that swallowed not just the land, but all memory of what was once there.\n\nNow, the world is on the brink. The Absence has nearly swallowed the whole of the physical Runiverse. Nearly all has been forgotten. What is remembered is fragmented and unreliable. But there is still hope.\n\nWith a little help from the few remaining mages in the physical world, a window from the Elsewhere has become a door to the Runiverse. The wizards of the past who were once banished must return magic to the world in order to restore the memory of what was, and push back the Absence.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/s/raw/files/10772e31e9dba89aa7dc6c12c105fe25.gif?w=500&auto=format"},

It is inspired by the aesthetics inherent in screen printing along with the compositions and colors of both Bauhaus, Constructivism, and pulp fiction sci-fi covers.\n\nThe compositions in \"Screens\" is based purely on strict geometries and plays with the tension, and symphonies that can be created from combining simple rules. The end result can range from chaotic non-figurative to strongly ordered isometric scenes.\n\nThe generative system underlying the rendering mimics the screen printing process by rendering and applying a single color at a time to a master image. Each virtual screen may be more or less aligned with the master, creating a lovely flawed balance to the precision of the rendered geometry.\n\n25% of the proceeds from this project will be donated to Den Blå Planet, The Danish National Aquarium, in support of their work on preserving and restoring marine life and ecology.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/n2xsI88RBBV8vxkQVvBlfO_4EVey3097-pgK29Oid-Id7aOGZrwE1qvi6eZBjiwrSfYEFTEsjvr_OXwDOkeBc_f_4EhnRFUVKg"},

The work is informed by notions of choreography, modular pattern composition and character design.\n\nKubikino is an idiosyncratic face, made of a combination of graphical elements and colours generated by code. Using an essential library of geometries - all deriving from the circle - and primary tones, the code randomly creates new faces resembling human physiognomy, animals and traditional masks.\n\nThrough the deliberate reference to a face, Kubikino prompts contemplation on the traditional notions of identity, similarity, and persona, as well as the ongoing need to establish one's own representation within a community - from traditional masks to digital avatars. For centuries, human identity has been a source of cultural fascination, with the word \"identity\" stemming from the Latin term \"identitas,\" signifying both \"sameness\" and “oneness.”\n\nInspired by Bruno Munari's \"Faces,\" a collection of abstract portraits created using basic geometric shapes and lines, Kubikino reflects on the simplicity, playfulness, and power of design to communicate across cultures and generations.\n\nDrawing upon the influential dance theories of Rudolf Laban and Merce Cunningham, Kubikino's device process for the creation of its faces is underpinned by a sophisticated framework of modular pattern composition. The project's generated output is organised into a grid-based structure, where each section corresponds to a phrase, and the relationship between the various sections collectively generates the final composition. Referencing Laban’s Movement Analysis, each section is paraphrasing LMA's four key components: body (loop), shape (direction), dynamic (colour), space (relationship within the space).\n\nKubikino also adopts the principles of \"chance\" and \"structured improvisation\" articulated by avant-garde pioneers John Cage and Merce Cunningham in the 1960s. The Kubikino identity is constructed from a selected array of animated graphics, rules, and paradigms that correspond to motifs, scores, and ensembles found in conventional art forms such as dance, music, and paintings.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0EPFQylMQRrbBLcecP0RNlz1nzK87KJykhImlzbPqszoYW9fEDcU4fXL3YW9a6_54D36pmIzsH8AnCSudBHI3MvUcdk0uO3WgNg"},

The main environmental parameter of the composition is the determination of a season of the year. The season determines the landscape’s colors and defines specific phenomena for each of them, such as rain in summer, snow in winter, petals falling in autumn, and pollen in spring. The flower has several possible variables, which can be macro aspects, affecting the entire population of the species, or micro, affecting each individual of the species differently. For example, the number of petals can be equal in all individuals or not. The number of filaments and other structures of the flower can undergo minor deviations, generating small mutations. The confusion between the figure (plant) and the background (earth, sky, other natural elements) is fascinating from a compositional point of view. The background colors are, most of the time, colors present in the figures, often breaking the boundary between them and, therefore, generating chromatic masses. In this project I also intend to research the following question: How to create parameters that resemble a living organism's growth? In this sense, the project approaches digital morphogenesis and the development of procedural organisms.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MzAJlgi8SpY3feDhGTCort9aRlbPCd27NPi-2-jUTGMY_I_1dGLr8jufCk79QEkm0_er8mMpg2M6kBm38ya-hXx6UhBqH92QhGM"},

I saved my favorite picture files and small free software files to floppy disks with a capacity of roughly 1 megabyte and stored them carefully. Those floppy disks were my treasure. Later, when the disks deteriorated and became unreadable or were lost, the data became memories with a deep feeling of loss.\n\nBlockchains have arisen. Are these truly persistent?\n\nAfter all, digital data are also a type of memories. They are stored in a person's mind, deteriorate, and one day will be lost with that person.\n\nI find the fragility and beauty in them.\n　\n\n\n\n\n\n　\nIn this work, I attempted to represent a fictional collapsed blockchain world with visuals and sound.\n　\nThe chain has already been abandoned, and the few nodes that remain barely alive are just maintaining their appearances. Visualizing the remnants of blocks that no longer serve their original purpose, they form something like a submerged city. Then, a large amount of data that has lost its connection to the blocks and has deteriorated to the point that it can no longer be opened, flutters through the sky. The countless remnants of data form a cloud, which undulates like a wave. The details of the data cannot be confirmed, however, they can be seen as glittering lights. As I try to recall the contents of the data that can no longer be opened, I am filled with vague memories and a sense of nostalgia.\n\nThis work started with generating sound by code. The sound of rippling waves can be heard by clicking on the screen. Since it would be impractical to store huge sound data on the blockchain, the sound was formed from white noise. In order to reproduce the sound of rippling waves, it was necessary to deepen my understanding of the structure of the sound by referring to academic papers. Then the sound was completed, and the visual imagination expanded from there.\n\nI like to visit the sea near my home and in other places. Different seascapes can be seen from different locations and angles. When I am there, idly gazing at the seascape and listening to the sound of the waves, I sometimes feel as if I am the only human there and the world has gone to ruin. If the world were ruined, this seascape and the sound of the waves would remain for a long time. This feeling and the fragility felt in digital data are the basis of this work. I imagine that the heaven or the graveyard where the lost data flies up in the sky and arrives may be a seascape like this.\n\nThe reason why I used data as lights and clouds drifting in the sky and moved them like waves is because I wanted to depict unrealistic behavior with a realistic subject matter and to express a beautiful and bizarre world in which these intertwine.\n\nFor the visual expression technique, I further pursued and evolved the drawing system that I have developed in \"GHOST IN THE CODE\" and my other works. Everything is composed of rectangles, indicating that this world is beginning to become low-resolution. Depth is linked to the size of the rectangles, and distant objects are represented by small rectangles as if they were in focus. Dispersion in the position and color of the rectangles indicate the degree of deterioration of the world. Moreover, the sky, blocks, and the surface of the water are identified and each has its own characteristics.\n\nAlgorithms generate various compositions, colors, and other features. I have attempted to make each output feel nostalgic and fresh at the same time. The blocks, which have lost their original meaning, are contrasted with the data, which exists in isolation from them, in stillness and movement. Occasional red clouds or blocks mean that they are corrected as red, the first color, due to missing information.\n\nThrough these integrations, I have attempted to create a work that can be stored on a blockchain, and that is both visually and sonically interactive.\n\n[NOTE]\n\n-To save the image press the 'S' key.\n-To change the flow velocity press the '↑' or '↓' key.\n\nModern hardware and browser hardware acceleration is recommended.

No compression, no Netscape, no social media, no NFTs. The JPEG compression has specifically enabled photography-based imagery on the net. It has always served that purpose and over time become the de facto default for showing high quality imagery online. But compression always leaves a trace, which has become the lens through which the network sees the world of uploaded images.\n\n\"A painting is not a picture of an experience, but is the experience.\" ― Mark Rothko\n\nJPEG tries to create an image programatically fully expressing that signature compression. An image that is like empty made from barely nothing, yet fully present in its blazing appearance. A work deeply material, expressing itself through the language of code and codec only. This is not a JPEG depicting an image. The JPEG is the image itself.\n\nDelving into the depths and peculiarities of the digital, tethered to art history, JPEG found its way to the surface. Generated color fields are utilised to trigger the compressing algorithm, resulting in a world of raw visual entities. Where the abstract expressionists cut out the depiction in painting, aiming to let the artist convey pure emotion, JPEG cuts out the artist's emotion and lets it emerge from within the algorithm. Carefully you could categorize the work as *compressionism*. An art form where the machine speaks in its own raw language, but nevertheless makes a direct touch to our human heart.\n\nJPEG is a collection of generative images in the JPEG file format. The work tries to break with the idea of the fixed file format, therefor creating the JPEG entirely from code using no image material whatsoever. The individual JPEGs are generated responsively at the moment of viewing based on the token hash as a random seed. You can literally drag the JPEG out from the browser window.\n\nJPEG pays tribute to interface culture, and as such the work is responsive and not scaling. When the work is resized, the work is again rendered and compressed. When viewed smaller, details will disappear, yet the composition stays recognisable. It’s like stepping back to see a work from further away. The choice of color wanders from monochromatic tones to the brutality of complete randomness and everything in between.\n\nIn honour of the blockchain and the web, the work is written in vanilla JavaScript, using no dependancies, and generates a standard JPEG. This way the file is downloadable, aiming for a materiality that comes as close as possible to the standard browser.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kFuNX4IUaGGwtl4ldvxLk0XY0NptN3FIFMriOvcfbHEJA44j9njtjJcvWqqAWEW9HloNWgZQNMt2Wvb-RANMD_cCpjYHH4AAWuw"},

Yet we fail to fully comprehend this in our daily errands. Entretiempos is an artwork that reflects on this, based on an aesthetic that pays a tribute to the works of Sonia Delaunay, František Kupka and other painters from their era, recreated by the usage of intersecting rings that create a varied and rich space.\n\nThe work plays with the time scales by painting dynamically and letting the viewer pause the work, restart, set it to loop indefinitely, painting and vanishing in an endless cycle. And it can be set to be done at varying speeds, to appreciate what happens in between the time scales (\"entre tiempos\", in Spanish).\n\nAlso, there is a broader theme that I find of interest to explore from every work that I engage with. It has to do with the concept of what I call total cognitive space, or the total range of possibilities that can be expressed / achieved with a given scenario and set of conditions. In this case, I was interested in expanding my rendition of the works of Delaunay into a broader space. How does this approach scale with varying parameter ranges? Is the painting still interesting? Can it express something new? Connected to this, I am also interested in thinking about what emotions would mean for an artificial sentient being. We talk about artificial intelligence, but leave aside artificial emotions all too often. While artificial intelligences are indeed interesting, we fail to recognize the paramount importance of emotions in human behaviour. To this end, this work explores also the result of painting with machine-like precision vs. performing the artwork with a range of possible imprecisions. The perfection of the machine vs. the imperfection of the human, does it trigger different emotions in us humans? What will the reaction of a machine be whenever they develop a taste?\n\nThis work exposes features that deal with its time and space scales, background colour, background elements, the palettes used, certain colour accents that may happen (golden accents, b&w tones), the style used to draw the geometric shapes (fill, lines, outline), the degree of paint precision and other features that influence the final result. The user may download a PNG file at any arbitrary resolution at any step of the paint process using the commands provided for that. A brief list of commands is as follows. Please note that you need to click on the artwork first to make sure it will receive the typed commands:\n\np to pause/resume the work\nr followed by y to enter the looping mode\nd followed by +/- or any number from 1 to 9 to increase resolution\ns followed by c to save current image\ns+f to automatically save the final image when the system finishes painting\ns+m to restart and save a sequence of images of the process\nr+0 (zero) to reset all parameters and resolutions and restart\nk at any time to define keyframes, then r+0 to restart the work and it will automatically pause at defined steps, or s+i and the work will restart and automatically save an image at every keyframe defined with k. Reload browser to reset.\n\nThere is an Easter egg hidden in every work.\n\nFor the full project description, inspiration and rationale, as well as the full list of features and controls plus a hint at the Easter Egg, please visit the project homepage at https://www.iillucid.com/entretiempos", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_7oB6tc8f3h0CuIoC1NihQSASyHwTdGyuRdB6oquKh8kUVIzSJ3LsPOD-h8-APin2pBaInSzlbvfCucw95TvH1zcjfpywNIaSLU"},

To increase this tension between dynamic motion and static mechanical process I wanted the surface textures to appear worn and aged like a drawing that has spent its life in the bottom of a mechanics drawer. This process of abrasion and discoloration is occurring on yet another scale of time adding complexity to the references of time passing. \n\nWoven into the very fabric of Fontana is a fully generative solution for creating color expression. This means there is no reliance on preset palettes with every output being an entirely unique color articulation of the color story I want the project to reveal as a whole. Far from being random I attempted to create an approach which produces colors that evoke early 20th Century art and design media.

We might think, “that is the tree outside my window. This is my house. That’s my friend. I’m me.” In fact, this type of abstraction is necessary for us to make any sort of sense of our world. But is the tree outside your window today truly the same tree as it was yesterday? Are you exactly the same person as you were yesterday? Or twenty years ago? In a sense, the abstraction is an illusion. Our physical reality is inseparable from the flow of time; everything is changing, all the time. Sometimes the changes are fast, and sometimes they’re imperceptible — but time never stops. Change never stops.\n\n__*because unless until*__ represents this concept in art, as a generative system of systems where each output changes over time. New days present new views of the algorithm, where a variety of mathematical shapes gradually and endlessly shift, demonstrating a more local and immediate form of change. Even so, each day’s appearance has enough in common with the one before it to provide the output with a continuous sense of identity. With the arrival of each day, what about the art has changed -- and what remains the same?\n\n\nChanging Over Time\n-\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of generative art is the joy of discovery when viewing a new output for the first time. I also enjoy the novelty that comes with watching a chaotic system evolve over time. But, once you’ve seen a particular output from a long-form generative art collection, you’ve seen it. My intent, with the time-based mechanics in this algorithm, is to preserve that feeling of discovery so that every viewing and every day brings something new. \n\nIn __*because unless until*__ colors are applied differently depending on the day of the week. The detail level of the animation changes over the course of a month, providing a different visual balance between the shapes, and the textures that fill them. Each month, the animation’s shapes are altered. The weave of these different cycles mean that each day has its own characteristics. It would take at least seven years to see every available combination.\n\nSome outputs come with “Daily Modes” tied to a specific day of the week, where colors and textures are altered in a particular way. Each output also comes with a \"Fiesta Day\" -- one day of the year where it shows a set of new behaviors. One day in December is designated as “Glitchmas” — a holiday shared across all outputs with another unique behavior. Glitchmas falls on a different day each year.\n\n\nAnimation\n-\n\nThe algorithm works by layering multiple animations, whose intersections are used to divide the canvas into regions that determine the palettes and rules for a section of the output. The rules are applied to an underlying field of cellular automata, which change state accordingly. At the core of the project is a generic framework that runs arbitrary animations in their own threads. The threading enables performant, fluid motion (I find it sensuous -- I often find myself thinking \"I want to run my fingers through it.). Threads run asynchronously, which in combination with the chaotic behavior of cellular automata means that outputs evolve in a unique, non-deterministic way each time. After a few minutes, the canvas is likely to be in a state that will no-one will ever experience again.\n\nThe animations in __*because unless until*__ are a return to some of my favorite mathematical techniques from a prolific period (2010-11) when I was first beginning to make art: Mandelbrot and Julia fractals, isolines, polar inversions, spirals, regular and irregular polygons, and — of course — cellular automata. It’s been a joy to revisit them, and to combine them with my more recent animated practice. As the animations progress, a variety of emergent features sometimes appear — such as cloudlike trails, regular and irregular structures, and moiré.\n\nThere are dozens of cellular automaton rules in the algorithm, which can take the states of surrounding cells as input in one of over a hundred ways. Derived from these rules, there are over a thousand possible textures, and billions of ways that a cell might change depending on its rules, state, and surroundings. The states of cells in an area around each cell are used in one of 18 different ways to select from the palettes available in the output — each of which is an interpolated gradient containing hundreds of colors. The large number of possible combinations contribute to a diverse pool of possible appearances.\n\n\nHelp\n-\n\nPress **[H]** to open a set of interactive menus providing additional information about the available time-based features and interactive controls. The “Today” panel provides realtime information about which detail level or special day is currently active.\n\nFor collectors wanting a more concrete experience, a “Canonical” mode is available that makes the animation appear as it did at unix epoch (January 1, 1970), and a “Synchronous” mode is available that makes animations evolve in a deterministic way (at the cost of performance). These modes are used when generating the thumbnail animations for each output.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1TCozsvNVNgSx-CoEdaBpYu07M31VAEeaLJmFBZNz0Sup0wCsuKB-8ZgcS2nGoOQwXnCFcjymAxelVY5LNRFWtCowq3D_c53qv8"},

Approach any problem from a position of complete ignorance and try to find the simplest way to solve it.\n2. Make the most with as little as possible and avoid introducing complexity unless absolutely necessary.\n3. Accept that intuition often falls short in predicting the best way forward (*especially* when creating generative art), and entertain any idea that presents itself.\n\nStaying mostly within the confines set by these rules, the development of Gumbo ended up taking me on many unexpected journeys.\n\nAt its core, Gumbo explores the diversity of form that can be achieved by combining simple shapes, such as spheres, donuts, boxes, and cylinders. Despite the basic components, the final arrangements are strangely familiar, some reminiscent of space stations, others of internal organs. By painting these structural canvases in an indiscriminate fashion, an intricate interplay between colour and form arises, emphasizing the spatial nature that underlies both. Texture, a subject I deeply appreciate, stars as the main character of Gumbo, celebrated both as a reference to the material world, and, especially, as something with uniquely digital characteristics. Present throughout the project, it is primarily used to illuminate the structures and add life to otherwise flat blocks of colour.\n\nWhile working on Gumbo, I've found inspiration from a diverse set of sources, ranging from the vibrant and captivating colours of Cold War-era propaganda posters and Japanese ukiyo-e to the texture-heavy work of artists like Virgil Finlay and Bruce Conner. In addition, Gumbo utilises a rendering approach that can be described as a digital equivalent of physical methods like silkscreen and woodblock printing, a connection that was not recognised until the project's later stages.\n\n**Note**: Gumbo requires WebGL2 and is computationally expensive to render.

Chaos theory’s most famous tenant, the Butterfly Effect, explains how imperceptible changes in initial conditions can lead to massive and unpredictable differences in outcomes: how a butterfly flapping its wings weeks earlier may lead to a hurricane taking a different course.\n\nWander positions Rhythm & the Machine at the paradox point, building a system that visually suggests both order and chaos, striking a different balance in each composition. Saturated color fields reminiscent of paint moving through water are seemingly randomly distorted and dragged across the canvas. All the while repeating colors and evenly spaced gestures point to an underlying ordered system.\n\nIntuitively you would not expect repeating the same thing over and over would lead to disorder, yet this is exactly what you find with many systems, such as pseudo-random number generators that are foundational to algorithmic generative art.\n\nThrough a reduced system that elevates a few “random” elements—the placement & size of colored geometric shapes, the direction & intensity of the gesture—Rhythm & the Machine introduces distortionary forces that Wander does not dictate nor completely control. Suddenly each cluster of colors takes on a life of its own, creating new forms we cannot predict.\n\nEach work in the collection contains a second ‘instruction’ layer, which maps how the original colored shapes are placed and then distorted. This ‘instruction’ layer reminds us that chaos is in fact rooted in ordered systems. We can see the before and the after of the directional forces, how regular shapes became an abstracted color field. At the same time, the interactions are so complex and layered that trying to anticipate the future is a futile effort. We can try to understand but we cannot predict: a visual articulation of the butterfly effect. This insight is given added weight since the instruction layer is artificial and not a priori to the original digital work, where all of these functions happen simultaneously. The artist constructed it to provide the viewer this unique insight.\n\nWe see the moment of divergence, repeated not just in a single canvas but also across the collection. The wide range of possibilities alludes to infinity—a concept impossible to fully comprehend but in this reduced visual language Wander shows us a piece of it and our minds are able to begin to explore the spread if not the edges.", "imageUrl": "https://meta.tonic.xyz/logo.jpg"},

Taking DRIFT’s widely exhibited Meadow installation as a point of departure, Schema comprises 300 unique, generative, and animated artworks uniting DRIFT and Davis’s artistic visions. \n\nThis collaborative new project is inspired by the beauty and simplicity of DRIFT’s two-dimensional schematic designs for Meadow, an upside-down landscape in which illuminated mechanical flowers open and close as part of a poetic choreography. Hung from a ceiling, this mesmeric work examines the impermanence of the changing seasons and the phenomenology of nature.\n\nAt its core, Schema is a love letter to the preliminary work that goes into realizing any large-scale art installation—in this case, diagram-making. Together, Gordijn, Nauta, and Davis developed a custom algorithm that brings the physical sculpture’s details and idiosyncrasies to life, recasting its diagrammatic origins in four possible styles: Diagram, the style that most closely resembles DRIFT’s preliminary diagrams for Meadow; Color Study, which strips out the structural elements of the diagrams and express the flowers as abstract rings of color; Sketch, which renders the flowers as line drawings with chalk-like accents; and Blueprint, which resembles the style of a blueprint.\n\nIn addition to these four different drawing styles, the project’s algorithmic system chooses two parent colors for each artwork, which may result in a wide spectrum of colors appearing across the composition from left to right or, alternatively, a more monochromatic scheme. The flowers themselves also have their own color systems that determine the relationship between their physical color and the color of their internal lights, creating gradient effects as the cast light blends with the local color. \n\nVariable traits in any given Schema artwork also include: the total number and location of the flowers; day and night modes that impact ambient light effects; each flower’s apparent position relative to the viewer; and the frequency and speed at which each flower opens and closes. Flowers in these artworks also run on their own cycles, deliberately avoiding synchronization and giving the whole scene a sense of organic motion. Once the viewer clicks on a static Schema composition to activate its motion, the animations in the artwork evolve endlessly.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fRAUPcuSJfUeIxispz1D3s_e2avppgmabGKPaqprGBU8Y9DvlknPIMkTNnKZDl7Uq6eFYvKNcb2BIrBzLUqAS7G0wLVF5K-nH_7F"},

At times they appear as strange beings; alive. To make sense of this phenomenon, we are forced to reconsider our notion of the living state beyond what we are familiar with on Earth. \n\nCalian is an infinitely zoomable and scrollable exploration of lifelike behaviour. It exhibits ambiguous natural-digital forms in a dynamic rendering. Species grow and compete; they get carried by the elements; they face boom, bust, and echo. \n\nWhat makes something alive? To go beyond recognition of terrestrial biology we need to delineate general principles and apply them to new intelligent systems. Calian uses the fruits of my research into the origin of life to create persistent, complex systems that we can experience and study (*). We can identify properties of living matter but these fall short of a satisfactory and succinct criterion. When does agency begin? Or identity? Calian asks you to ponder this as you wander through its ecosystems. \n\nFeel free to explore but be careful: although life is pervasive, living things are delicate. Your interactions affect the ecosystem, obliquely. \n\nCalian continues a thread of my work probing deep scientific questions with artistic means. It furthermore connects to my previous Artblocks projects Mazinaw and Glass through the theme of ambiguity: while Mazinaw suggested the hand of an unknown creator, and Glass visualized the intrinsic ambiguity of our quantum mechanical universe, Calian's amorphous forms bear characteristics both of familiar organic matter and digital technology. \n\nInteractive features allow you to explore each ecosystem, infinitely, both in depth and in scope. As you wander, the shader repopulates the world from its initial condition, while the physical laws governing the dynamics themselves evolve.\n\nSee Display Notes for Controls.\n\n(*) For more on Calian's dynamics and its grounding in my research, see the Calian page on my website.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KfW6VQbzYuci9Swt1-wqPlIBl_HyPgwflnNcU8CTeKh6edtsWHEQkDSRdanYtGFxL4RtohAixo-gWW1yB9uQXkcPu6-nviKZdA"},

The combination of illusion and tactility found in these interfaces shows our longing to have the computer experience to be part of the material world. Therefore it comes as no surprise that the programming language of Ethereum is named 'Solidity'. The blockchain is software, yet it behaves and feels like hardware.\n\n🪨\n\nWindow pays tribute to interface culture, and as such, the work is responsive and not scaling. When the work is viewed on a smaller scale, details will disappear, yet the composition stays recognisable. It is like stepping back to see a work from a distance. The work can also increasingly reveal more details when made larger. As a result Window will keep unfolding in the future as resolutions will grow.\n\nThe work follows standard window interactions. Double clicking or tapping the title bar will toggle between full browser and windowed view. On a laptop or desktop in windowed view, you can drag and resize your Window as you please. When made tiny, it makes for a nice profile pic. Clicking or tapping the background will cycle through three different background colours.\n\nWindow comes in seven latent colours and both in Windows Classic or Mac Classic style.\nWith the feature ‘Latent colour’ I look at the invisible steps within the procedure of a generative artwork. I love the idea that the script has chosen to feature a colour, but in a later step could fail to make it to the composition. By showing the colour as a feature, I try to extend the visual work with deeper invisible layers of the generative process.\nCheck the features to see what colour is seeded.\n\nIn honour of the blockchain and the web, the work is written in vanilla JavaScript, using no dependancies, and generates standard HTML DOM aiming for a closer feel of the user interface.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0a6VBhbGo1PRaYJ8AKknjRguEGqVyIeBQrkOufuPacGbxC28_YoswF4KKPXVcuEozkWKObuH-kx9QAQpoDyHHlJFWd9XHxZCazg"},

The price you purchase is the price you will pay.*\n\nAn ideal human being is one big optimization problem. We have a goal - we optimize our actions to maximize the outcome of this goal. \nIn our initial days, we optimize to stay alive, during school, we optimize to study well, gain skills and obtain the best scores.\n\nAs we progress in our careers we optimize to get the most amount of money, material growth, and maybe even influential growth such as fame.\n\nAs we age we optimize to minimize diseases and maximize our lifespan - we workout, we eat healthily, we retire, and rest \n\nAs ideal as it sounds, how do we know what exact actions would lead to maximizing my outcome? At this very moment - instead of reading this should you be doing something else that would make your life’s outcome better? Maybe, maybe not - We don't know... Although, we do find out through trial and error. \n\nIn the grand scheme of things we’re just an agent exploring actions around us, learning which ones increase our reward and choosing the path that seems to lead to the maximum reward. Cerebellum is a window (pun intended) of the human mind - a continuously evolving art piece that is built on top of a reinforcement learning agent that is learning and optimizing and evolving as you see it. \n\nThe project starts with an untrained model of a reinforcement learning agent that is deployed in an environment where it is faced with positive reward and negative reward. The agent is also equipped with a bunch of eyes that lets it sense the objects around it and judge if it wants to go ahead and consume the object or abstain and move in a different direction. The agent here is optimization to maximize its positive rewards while avoiding the negative ones. How does the agent know if a reward is positive or negative? - It learns that after experiencing a bunch of samples. And the magic is - all of this happens in your browser. The seemingly random motion of the agent at the beginning running into everything it sees subsides with time as it learns better about the environment and only hits on the positive rewards. How fast does this happen? Depends on your luck - every art has agents with varied number of eyes and range of these eyes. In addition with every refresh your agent would start from a new place, taking a new path - a path that might lead to it learning things at a different pace depending on what it comes across as it explores. To add some practicality - the environment also has some walls, elements that just block the agent from moving doesn’t add or decrease rewards. Hinders the agent’s movement, lets it find a different path - sometimes this is needed for the agent to strategize, sometimes it's just a hindrance… I’ll leave this to your imagination as you see the agent in action…\nThe seemingly random motion - the path towards true understanding - the process of optimisation is captured by the windows. Windows that show the beauty of this process expressed in a variety of ways. \n\nCerebellum is a window into the black box of AI, an unapologetic exaltation of the unpolished, an ode to the process and its aesthetic vernacular.\n\n+ Press 'p' to switch from 2d/3d views\n+ Press 'e' to expose the reinforced learning layer\n+ Press 't' to pause/unpause the training of the agent\n+ Press 'w' to randomize the walls of the training environment\n\nOn mobile, tap to switch from 2d to 3d", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IXOaZrtzimk2zWsnhlbT68gNX4rSHi-at2QEXKeLrqg7BAyRDcy-9gORGm24vIS9FnKbUJ-mFYsTYo4Qyu-sOfuByv7IJzFWUGc"},

One of Frieder Nake’s best-known works is the “Hommage à Paul Klee”, which was created in 1965 and paid tribute to the Bauhaus artist by the principle of chance. “Chance is better than me”, Gerhard Richter was once quoted when he made colour charts based on algorithms.

Like the book's exploration of Venice, the pieces in \"Invisibles\" are rooted in the essence of Hong Kong, a city the creator called home for nine years.\n\nEach piece in this series captures the spirit of a different city, creating a beautiful and intricate mosaic of shapes, and patterns. The detailed engravings of architecture from the 18th and 19th centuries influenced its visual style while exploring the conceptual connection between engravings and code as a generation source.\n\nThis collection is plottable and aims to transcend the digital realm becoming tangible as an added dimension to the artwork beyond digital printing.

Whether encapsulated in physical or computational techniques, these processes act with their own degree of autonomy from our own biases and as a result, open up new ideas and sensibilities while dismantling traditional notions of authorship. They allow one to code the possibility of discovery and surprise into the creative process in a manner that can be widely shared and because of this transmissibility, algorithms frustrate the idea of a single author, inviting speculation on the shared nature of creativity. For this reason we have always understood our work to be a collaboration between each other, those who share with us and those who inspire us. \n\nOver the years, the studio has indulged in a number of obsessions. One is the conviction that history is a generative source with which to constantly entangle. Whether it is through stories, characters, techniques, or events, history acts as a medium active with properties that constantly reshape and transform our concept of the present. We look back to move forward, like hitching a ride. It is here that we encounter Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528) and his masterpiece Melancholia I (1514) to inspire a deep dive into the process of engraving as a representational technique reinterpreted through the contemporary medium of code. By scratching metal away from a plate, an inversion of conventional drawing, engraving allowed a work of art to be reproduced and disseminated widely. In addition to the piece’s masterful delineation, its allegory resonates with us as well. In Dürer’s time melancholy was associated with insanity but also with creativity. In the engraving, the winged personification of melancholy -- the work is widely regarded to be a self-portrait of the artist -- is surrounded by the tools and elements of geometry. For Dürer, as for a handful of others who came before and after, who test the porous borders between art, science and religion, geometry is a vehicle for imagination, a shadow of the divine and a portal to the infinite. \n\nThis work Primitives is a kindred meditation on infinity through an exploration of a novel geometric structure using algorithm and code, the tools of today's geometers and mystics, made visible through the anachronism of the engravers trade translated into pure 1’s and 0’s. Primitives grows through a single shape that can repeat and scale in specific ways that are never random, but rather tightly governed by geometric logics. It is about drawing infinity through a radical modularity; ordered but aperiodic. Unlike a regular crystal, whose molecular pattern is periodic (or repetitive in all directions), the distinctive quality of this quasicrystal is that its structural pattern never repeats the same way twice. Endless and uneven in aggregate, Primitive clusters can be described by the precise arrangement of a single modular part. As these small units aggregate together they form larger figures that themselves combine into ever larger movements, always a little bit different from any other. In this sense, quasicrystalline patterns have an infinite capacity to create and carry information. \n\nWe are here because this is a medium for sharing in perpetuity. In the last couple of years, on the cusp of our third decade of practice, we have watched with awe and delight a renaissance in generative work as it's adopted by an entirely new generation around blockchain technologies. This inspired us to enter this new space with our own enduring questions of form and geometry, modularity and variability, historical continuity, and the thirst for endlessness. Primitives is what we selected as our primer into generative art on-chain because both the work and the medium grapple with these questions. \n\nSome Notes:\nOn the screen, Primitives is represented as a two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional figure. Each invocation comes with a sequence of projections, or rotations, around this object. As Primitives spins, there are moments when its blocks snap into alignment with other blocks  revealing its underlying lattice and crystalline nature. Each projection can be saved as a high resolution image for printing. Primitives can also be saved in three dimensions as an .obj file for a variety of uses including the creation of a physical object through 3-d printing or fabrication.

I've often wondered where a machine's mind and \"hand\" would wander given the same opportunity.\n\nThis project explores the age-old computer art phenomenon of inviting the viewer to actively participate in the interpretation of the visual output. The way \"Sharp-E\" draws the strokes is through a mix of various movements — irregular curves, straight lines, sudden changes in direction — in a classic random walk algorithm, while avoiding overlaps with previously drawn strokes. There are no pre-programmed forms per se, but nevertheless it can be common for the viewer to perceive images, symbols, meaning in the generated output.\n\nSo where does your mind wander? What forms, symbols, and meaning do you see?\n\nControls:\n• 'D' toggles pausing/drawing or continues space-filling after the first stop (if available)\n• 'R' reassembles the piece (This automatically happens every minute)\n• 'S' saves the output", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Bdbst7e0bHRVnAJuKRRaG9m16vO_A122Fly97aktdBv9CGlWY8kY2zKlH7wngg3snRdffc5QcSDdZaBUi-7ekuHOY4YasGrLYg"},

The idea is simple. You start with a string of nodes connected to one another to form a shape. Each node feels 3 forces:\n - A repulsion force from all other nodes\n - An attraction force towards its immediate neighbors\n - An attraction force towards the midpoint between its neighbors\n\nAs you add more nodes into the shape, these 3 rules cause the shape to curve into itself, growing into a complex form of layered undulating lines. The goal is to create a shape that fills as much space as possible while maintaining a rigid form and avoiding overlapping itself. By focusing specifically on where and when you add more nodes, and how you interpret those nodes into a shape, there is much variety to be found in this simple algorithm.\n\nSince I first learned about this technique, and wrote my own version based off these rules, I have been continuing to iterate, evolve, and optimize my code. It's an algorithm I always find myself coming back to, and has become my most researched topic and longest running experiment. I love its use of real life physics, and I find its outputs aesthetically pleasing on a deeper, almost instinctual level. \n\nEach output of 'Spaghetti Bones' starts with a simple shape as a seed for the differential growth algorithm. Throughout the rendering process, the shape is fed more nodes, and grows until it cannot find any empty space to fill. As it grows, a form is interpreted from the nodes of the growth and drawn onto the screen, creating a snapshot of the growth at that particular moment. There are many rules that govern how the shape grows, and how its form is interpreted, and these rules often evolve throughout the rendering process. When the render is complete, the resulting image is a full catalog of the history of the shape's life. \n\nThe name of this project was created by Nicole, my girlfriend and an art wizard. Early on in the development of this project, I asked her to name an output I was sharing, and she chose to call it ‘Spaghetti Bones’ because that’s what it looked like. Since then, the name has stuck with me. I decided to keep the name for the final project in order to highlight the playfulness of each output, to encourage imagination when viewing this abstract art, and to thank Nicole for being tremendously supportive and helpful throughout my exploration of the art world.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/c8DbQviFttlTfW3gM57CU83Q1RefgHcYcjqXLS8O85kRKfktwfLWgvRJ6_Lw9tfjKqObxpDLkGajsd8eqEcLQoeVrpcMOW2_VF4"},

The title derives from Mazinaabikinigan-zaaga'igan, an Algonquin word meaning “picture” or “writing”, alluding to the dual nature of pictographs. \n\nInspired by my encounters with neolithic cave paintings in Europe and indigenous pictographs flanking Canadian lakes, Mazinaw hints at etchings, drawings, and anthropomorphic forms. While Mazinaw draws on expressionists from Wassily Kandinsky to Norman Lewis, it takes abstraction one step further: each piece is constructed by the artist indirectly, via a generative code, allowing the emergence of new undreamt-of forms.\n\nThe 19 palettes are inspired by the natural world, but their roles are sometimes twisted: cerulean blue strokes appear over an ochre canvas, and green flashes of light hop across a gray expanse. I invite the viewer to spend time with each piece, finding their own order from chaos. Signed fine-art archival inkjet prints will be available for owners at a modest cost.\n\nNote: Mazinaw is best viewed in large format (full screen), or printed. Each piece has infinitely fine details, some of which will only be visible in print. Mazinaw renders seamlessly in any aspect ratio; adjust the window size and shape as desired, click on the frame, and type 'f'. \n\nControls:\n\n s   -- save as png\n spacebar  -- pause/unpause\n  f   -- toggle square / fit-to-screen aspect ratio\n   1-6  -- set pixel density (default=2 on retina displays)\n   +/-  -- increase/decrease pixel density\n   n -- enable/disable night mode\n   p -- enable/disable pastel mode", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/klB7Scl1CXv-sriPrPYioEb4fvbp1wA3VNfElYBDolOft0g3BQEnUASqHJxtwqqZ1tQLqsGAQEFufY55GGCn8oqogb0ldnXCWxs"},

Each flag is sited in a fictitious future desert generated uniquely using code-based frequencies, shapes, colours, and skies. These data worlds are spatial and solar—viewers can look around the scene by dragging in its window. Dawn breaks and night falls accurately for the locale that each flag represents across day and year.\n\nWorld Flag imagines a shared but bleak and deeply inequitable future in which ongoing governmental and legislative failures alongside environmental degradation and mismanagement have rendered the state as a ghost, as an apparition of itself. The national flag is reimagined as a performed militaristic sign for a doomed place-based political order.\n\nAll 195 World Flags in the series are generated from one 112 KB script stored on-chain. This script uses the WebGL (web graphics language) protocol, a new medium which allows complex visual data worlds to be rendered directly in the web browser. When distributed using the blockchain mechanism and viewed on mobile electronic devices, the work and medium propose a global public art experience—post place, post geography. \n\nThese are spatial worlds - drag on the scene to look around. Press F on a keyboard for full screen, R to slowly rotate the camera. M to hide the mouse pointer. On a phone or touch screen tip the top of world to go full screen. Tip bottom of world to rotate camera.  Tip top again to leave full screen. Tip bottom again to leave rotation. \n\nFurther Notes\nThe ClimateWatch 2019 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions index for the 195 member countries of the UN is a key conceptual underpinning of World Flag. The artworks from the project will be released in a predetermined order based on the 195 countries’ respective GHG emissions, from highest to lowest, irrespective of population size.\n\nGerrard will also produce a single Artist Proof (A/P) World Flag NFT—a composite of all 195 countries represented in the project that will be reserved for institutional acquisition, and it will be minted upon donation.\n\nJohn Gerrard will dedicate 10 percent of artist’s proceeds from World Flag sales to Hometree, a nonprofit organization that works to address Ireland’s declining biodiversity and the global climate crisis. Through its Wild Atlantic Rainforest Project, Hometree is restoring a temperate rainforest in Ireland, a unique ecosystem.\n\nIn 2021, Gerrard became the first artist within Pace Gallery's program to release an NFT with Western Flag (NFT), an artwork derived from his simulation Western Flag (Spindletop, Texas) 2017, which was commissioned for Earth Day 2017 by Channel 4 in the UK. Western Flag (NFT) recently became the first NFT to be acquired by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\n\nGerrard’s Petro National generative NFT series, released in 2022, was the first Web3 project to be produced as part of the multifaceted collaboration between Art Blocks and Pace Verso. In 2023, Petro National #16 (Nigeria) was acquired by the Centre Pompidou in Paris.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/v_xDY8YLjklDnHT7f52BjHvjGN1jWZmZCaEmy4T0iXrd9dPrQvdcdBTXIiUIsdwQUEkA1cY5bB8II3x2NwX1JpDc3pQK80LPuw"},

A personal obsession, I drew and redrew it hundreds of times until I felt it reached the perfect form in balance, weight, and drama.\n\nThis generative series revisits my captivation with this character object, using the algorithm as a tool for continued obsession and exploration. I want people to experience this collection and never see a “2” in the same way again. I also want to remind viewers that exquisiteness can exist in any mundane thing.\n\nMy background in graphic design and typography is ingrained in how I think. Regardless of medium, I have always been a designer of iteration, exhaustively trialing possibilities within a set of constraints to uncover the best way, or the most ways. Twos takes a “perfected” form and puts it to a further test. Different outputs situate the form in different contexts, look at it askew, or emphasize isolated parts of it for endless results.\n\nThe texture within the collection is inspired by low resolution effects (pixelation) and textures that arise from analog printmaking techniques and pen lines. It blends the hand-drawn nature of my original “2” with the power of obsessive exploration only possible with computer generative iteration. Layers of tiny squares, under and above the characters, are used to mimic the texture of a pen or a stamp. Found in much of my work, these “visible pixels” represent the physical module upon which digital art is created - and by calling back to pixel art, act as a reminder that code is still a craft, and the generated image isn’t far from the artist’s hand.\n\nBeyond the beauty of the form, the number two is a special quantity because it implies possibilities beyond itself. A system containing zero or one elements is inert. Two creates an interaction, a dyad, and implies the possibility of more than two – an expanding system. In computer programming, this is expressed as the \"zero, one, infinity\" rule. The two represents a potentially endless continuation.\n\nEach feature in the collection represents either the analog or the digital journey of this character. Some compositions render each symbol as linework, reminiscent of its earliest hand drawn form. Others render it as the solid numeral, completed after its long journey of iteration. Some compositions are gridded, others are organic and loose. Some are contained by a frame, others are open and unrestrained.\n\nColor enters a few outputs: the mark of new technological tools like the first colored ink in printing, or the move from black and white to digital screens. The brightest hues used depend on light emittance of the screen and wouldn’t translate exactly when printed in standard inks. But in a further application of constraint, most outputs are neutral in color, keeping the focus on the formal obsession with this small, beautiful character.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/2925f459f0a95ac8a7b6088677051e8c.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

I watched and watched, my eyes filling with tears, after all this time, it all still had a hold on me.

The illness is in my family and in that of close friends of mine, and this work is more of a raw expression of emotion than anything else. Holding hands with a person who is fading away is a strong experience, one that allows oneself to recalibrate and to, in a way, regenerate one's vision of what life is, what a person is, what relationships are. It's commonplace to hear that a loved one who is already gone is still alive \"in our memory\". The truth is that this is the case when we are all alive and good as well, but only take notice when there is a crossing over event. We don't see the person almost anymore, but there's a body there that sometimes still reacts. How much of what we ignore that is going on is relevant? Is this song we just played relevant? What do emotions look like when the brain that processes them is failing? Are we ready to understand those, with our limited knowledge of what we are? Is the person still there when there is no sign of them? And when they are not there, why can we not cut the cord? The simple touch of their skin is enough to make the person come alive in that instant in our very memories. Maybe we are in theirs, in that moment, in a shape we don't comprehend.\n\nVisually, the project merely projects faces. Fading, waving. Unstable, some smiling, some sad. A diversity of lives emerges in the piece, exploring with generative techniques the emotions of you, the experiencer of the piece. Maybe it does not resonate with you, but maybe it gives you a chance to connect with those feelings that are otherwise hard to get close to. We see a person and their dreams, their ideas, their memories as dancing colorful geometries. Their fears, ther recurring thoughts. But sometimes they look like a nightmare. Sometimes they are mute. We see some lines where the faces are enclosed. These are a template for a human, the lines that dictate where our facial features should be. But they dance with the memories as time passes by - is our notion of human also a moving target? Sometimes you will see more than one face, an expression of the many lives we might have lived. And at any time, we can summon a view of the piece where we see you in me. _You in me_.\n\nAllowing ourselves to be a companion of someone else's difficult passage is a window into our own humanity. An occasion for regeneration.\n\nWorks best on Chromium browsers. Firefox macos has some problem with geometries drawn with p5.js in webGL mode.

Each year, trees add a new ring to their trunks, recording their growth and responding to the changing seasons and environmental conditions. These rings tell a story of the tree's life. By replicating these patterns, the project captures the rhythmic and organic qualities of nature.\n\nIn this project, I wanted to explore the aesthetic and conceptual possibilities of tree rings through code-based art. I used a generative algorithm to simulate the growth of virtual trees, generating patterns that resemble the annual rings of real trees, but with a twist. Instead of using traditional circular or oval shapes, I experimented with different geometric forms and noise. I also played with colors and instead of using earthy and realistic colours, the palettes are inspired by the richness and diversity of the natural world.\n\nThe algorithm works by starting with the outer most ring, which over time grows towards an arbitrary chose center according to certain rules and parameters. Each iteration adds a new layer of shapes inside the previous one, mimicking the accumulation of tree rings. I introduced random mutations and variations, which introduce unexpected and unpredictable outputs, evoking the unpredictability of natural processes.\n\nEach artwork is inviting the viewer to contemplate the complexity and diversity of nature. I hope that this project will inspire others to explore the wonders of nature and to experiment with code-based art as a means of expression and exploration.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/62be5f1e594a61d0fbc7414d425b16a2.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

In addition to “tides”, which are low frequency oscillations of the ocean, higher frequency changes or “waves” are frequently discussed in reference to both water and electrical signals.

By considering the relationship between sound frequencies rather than musical notes, the piece explores the possibilities of harmony without the constraints of an instrument. \n\nUtilizing specific intervals which the human ear perceives as balanced, the algorithm creates a chord by computing a set of frequencies which are multiples or subdivisions of the interval. Combining this algorithm with the hash, Ratio produces a unique chord for each mint, with varying levels of tension, brightness, and microtonal deviation. \n\nThe sound field washes up against visuals which evoke streams of light falling across a series of panes. Sound data slowly illuminates and transforms the panes over time, creating a meditative respite for viewers. \n\nA full length fx(text) article about the theory behind Ratio is available here: https://bit.ly/ratio-theory\n\n\n~ Interaction ~\n\n- Press “f” to toggle fullscreen mode\n- Press “r” to record a 30-second video clip with audio. Use Safari for highest quality video and mp4 format. Chrome is next best but can only output the webm format (which you can then convert to mp4 via an online tool such as https://www.freeconvert.com/webm-to-mp4)\n- Press “1” to toggle between the generated chord and the closest possible match on a piano\n\n\n~ Aspect Ratio ~\n\nOutputs will automatically switch between landscape 16:9 or portrait 9:16 based on the size of your window. If you’d like to enforce a specific aspect ratio, you can append the parameter “?aspect=[number]” to an output’s URL. For instance, “[output_url]?aspect=1” will enforce a square aspect ratio regardless of the window size and fullscreen mode.\n\n\n~ About Night Sea ~\n\nRatio is the second generative audiovisual project by Night Sea, following their first release, l.o, on Art Blocks in September of 2023.

The hand selects a metal implement, cuts off a slab of clay, and carves into its surface. It wanders like your hand wanders; it carves imaginary contours, sinuous and exploratory. It doesn’t know the end result so it carves lines until it feels content, and then it numbers the piece and stamps its maker’s mark. It fires the slab in a digital kiln (it calls this “minting”) and through this act its art is preserved for millennia. The hand runs its fingers over the textured surface, feeling satisfaction at having spontaneously produced a piece of art so beautiful, expressive, and unique.\n\n---\n \nCeramics is a generative sculpture that mimics the physical expression of carving into clay. Through uncanny naturalistic rendering it challenges our notion of “handmade”. It asserts that the value of handmade isn’t the time it takes to make the work nor the physical materials consumed, but the endless small decisions and serendipitous details that appear along the way, as can be felt in each Ceramics mint.\n\nDespite the handmade nature of Ceramics the outputs cannot be touched. Highly tactile images enchant the viewer to imagine their tangible representations, and leave them to dwell on their perception of materiality — both in the experiential physical world and conceptually-infinite digital space.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/9de6f9bae207a06ef4091efaa2287504.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

A systems based approach to creation leaves space for things to emerge that the artist had not conceived. In its best form, it also enables the creation of artwork with complete unity of concept, system, and manifestation as they become one and the same.\n\nIn Seating Arrangements, Shannon highlights both the matrix and its product, the print. The algorithm generates a digital file that serves as the blueprint. These unique instructions are then executed by a CNC machine to carve out the distinct sections of the chair. The carved wooden slab is inked, simulta- neously creating the print and painting the final chair. Finally these pieces are assembled to create a free standing chair entirely from the matrix—without any hardware. The print becomes a record of an inter- mediate event and the matrix is shared as the final assembled sculptural piece of furniture.\n\nIn this series, the generative algorithm does more than ornament the final structure: it is central to the very essence of the chair. The artist defined 220 short, straight segments of wood that can be included or excluded by the algorithm and can intersect with up to 13 other segments. The repeating geometry of the design allows the viewer to see the positive form of the chair in the included segments and the nega- tive form of the chair in the absence of those that are not.\n\nThe range of possibilities for this algorithm is 2^220, or 1,684,996,666,696,914,987,166,688,442,938- 726,917,102,321,526,408,785,780,068,975,640,576 unique chairs. The incomprehensible multitude of potential chairs elevates one of Shannon’s core questions in the work: what is a chair? Many of the potential outcomes are not sittable, but does that exclude it from being a chair if it still registers as one visually?\n\nIf you were to overlap all of the chairs, there would be no single element that is shared by all. The viewer is denied an understanding of the platonic form of a chair, as there is no one common feature that can be distilled as the essence of chair within this series.\n\nThe removed segments insert a new dimension to the relationship between body, consciousness, and object. So much of what we come into contact with on a daily basis is designed to recede in our minds— consider “pain free” UI/UX or an office chair. We constantly interact with engineered systems that do not assert themselves. Their recession can mean forgetting that they exist at all, and forgetting that they are designed for their own purposes outside of our wants and needs.\n\nThe unique generative structures and simple materiality of Seating Arrangements mean these chairs do not disappear, but rather insert themselves into your consciousness. You must think of how to sit down, perhaps where to put your arm. This awareness of your body and your relationship to the piece reminds you that it has its own identity.", "imageUrl": "https://meta.tonic.xyz/logo.jpg"},

The name refers to the incense made from sandalwood that is common in Sudan. While sandaliya is the oil of sandalwood used as perfume, Bakhoor Assandal is the incense, burned on coals, made from the same wood. One could say it is the same substance gone up in smoke.\n\nThis project is a continuation of _Sandaliya_, a series that interweaves personal memories and familial connections in Sudan against the growing conflict. In April 2023, a civil war ignited, and many were forced to evacuate. _Bakhoor Assandal_ uses JavaScript and GLSL to create outputs in constant disarray. With a particular focus on movement, the algorithm builds layer by layer, with each pixel in perpetual shift, never replicating its past form –– a testament to life’s relentless change. Like the ephemeral smoke of burning incense, we must embrace the flow, knowing we will remember the scent.\n\n\n**_Notes_**\n\nExperience it in real time: click or press the spacebar to toggle the animation.

How some of them are small, fleeting and ephemeral while a select few become lifelong bonds. The work examines the intricate graphs that are formed by these connections. Graphs are all around us and have existed for as long as we have been human. From early settlements of hunter-gatherers and nomadic tribes to the internet of today. It's all graphs.\n\nNära allows the viewer to explore and experience these graphs as a metaphor for the organic, organised chaos that is life. Shapes connect from one node in a graph to the next, sometimes spilling over, doubling down and creating layers of intricacy. Imperfection is embraced and Nära exposes the chaotic and unpredictable elements of life. \n\nThe artistic vision of Nära is to highlight and expose graphs in a tactile manner that allows the viewer to see the whole graph, but also engage with the details and texture.  In doing this, Nära attempts to bring a novel contribution by pushing the boundaries of graph representation and introducing an emotional dimension to this oftentimes rigid and scientific discipline. By treating graphs as a metaphor for relationships in life, they become an integral part of the concept and an important artistic tool. \n\nNära takes inspiration from the De Stijl movement in reducing the world into a deliberate expression in its smallest form and builds upon the use of shapes imbued with meaning in the works of Hilma af Klint. These ideas are expanded on by accepting that what is deliberate must also relinquish some control through the pseudo-randomness of generative art. This invites reflection on the balance of control and chance in our lives. \n\n_Through Nära, you are invited to reflect on the connections in your own life and on the significance of the relationships that define us as human beings._ \n\nTo interact with the script:\n- Press 's' to save.\n- Add the following to the URL:\n  - pd=x, where x is a number to control the resolution via pixel density (useful for rendering high resolution stills)\n  - rs=x, where x is a number to enable and control the rendering buildup animation.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/e806ad9010186cb75e84ae5080a33438.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

Whether it's on a personal level, with constantly evolving relationships, or on a larger scale, with natural disasters, pandemics, and wars that disrupt our lives, chaos is a constant companion. But chaos doesn't always have to be negative; it can also bring unexpected beauty and moments of clarity if we're willing to take a closer look.\n\n\nFor artists, chaos can be a powerful tool in creative expression. Long-form generative art is a unique way to incorporate randomness into artwork, allowing for the creation of a series of distinct pieces based on the same code. Seasky is an example of this, with its prominent display of the construction process, showcasing the creation of clouds that seek to dominate the scene. The interplay between light, clouds and sea adds depth and intrigue to the piece. As the scene evolves, the inclusion of noise on the horizon and soaring birds creates an emotive and captivating view.\n\n\nSeasky was born from my exploration of the realm of chaos. As an artist, I love to experiment with generative art code, and during the creation of this collection, I discovered an unconventional method of creating clouds by layering objects at specific intervals. Pushing the limits of this technique, I found myself drawn to clouds that started to resemble painterly styles by 19th century masters such as JMW Turner and Gustave Courbet. For me, these styles emanated a sense of power and emotion that other constructs using this technique could not match. The introduction of the sea (itself inspired by impressionist techniques), and noise on the horizon, which interacts with the sky, results in a collection that showcases the beauty of chaos.\n\n\nDuring my creation of Seasky, I also experimented with color. While I typically rely on generative randomized color rather than predefined palettes, for this collection, I imposed limits on greens and overall saturation levels to create a more natural feel. Despite this, I found that adding some unnatural reds, oranges, and blues contributed to the overall aesthetic, creating a fantastical element that enhances the collection in an unpredictable way.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/4783d3c5fe07a0dca0805fe5c14871a1.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

In this series called Neural Sediments, inspired by the works of Alberto Burri, František Kupka, and Swiss topography, I highlight the complexity of our brains and some of their biases.\n\nLooking at one Neural Sediment will deliver you a first broad impression; however, looking at it for a longer time will yield a never-ending and much more nuanced and delicate observation. Like Alberto Burri’s Cracks series, some things not obvious to the eye become real over time. Each Neural Sediment opens itself to the viewer in a unique way. The more you look at it, the more you can decipher it. \n\nLike Swiss alpine glacier sediments, this material appears only after a certain amount of time and a decent amount of gravity. Burri used a special technique to envision time with cracked canvas; František Kupka, in his Katedrála painting, opens the fourth dimension by looking at the vertical lines of the glass window.\n\nIn the Neural Sediments series, I used both as an inspiration to push the viewer’s eye to search for more details and a deeper perspective.\n\nChoosing color palettes for a long-form generative art collection is as demanding as solving technical algorithmic challenges. \n\nThe color palettes I create result from a process I've built into my practice over time. Each palette comes from my own algorithmic selection trained on classical masterpieces.\n\nAfter this first selection, each set of colors used in a Neural Sediment is re-arranged to be linked with endangered ecosystems such as dark blue waters, peach salmons, rare botanic species, or volcanos.\n\nLike Josef Albers, who highlighted the instability and deceptiveness of colors, my color sets are here to reinforce the question of objectivity in the art world and life in general.\n\nLooking at its overall structure, each Neural Sediment evokes a brutalist architecture. \n\nPrioritizing function over form, each Neural Sediment aims to be used as a tool to rediscover oneself, free from the cognitive constraints we put on ourselves and the world around us.\n\nPS: From a technical point of view, Neural Sediments require some heavy calculations, considering the very large number of intersections to compute prior to rendering.\n\nPPS: Pressing the letter “i” on your keyboard will generate a high resolution export for a large scale and print friendly format.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/793c723785d65aed7918c9c98ab2372e.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

After two frenetic years she needed to take a step back and focus on developing her technique and art practice. ESCAPE is the product of this pace change, its icon, and a map guiding us towards this same freedom.\n\nFor Velitchkova the relationship between artist and machine is deeply collaborative, nurturing unexpected elements that emerge from the code. This algorithm began in systems that balance order and chaos. First a distinctive style reminiscent of architectural maps emerged. From this grew the brutalism characteristic of former Soviet cityscapes of the artist’s early childhood in Bulgaria. Ultimately stifled by this rigidity and repetition, Velitchkova pushed the algorithm further—breaking it and in the result discovering the form of an opera house, a structure that had become a symbol of freedom to the artist, the promise of losing oneself in art.\n\nThe overwhelming superstructure of architectural lines breaks the picture plane and seems to go beyond three dimensionality. By avoiding easy categorization, the viewer spends time considering the forms and making sense of the composition. It becomes possible to escape everyday concerns for a moment longer, lost in the almost mathematical task of viewing these geometries. The opera house icon emerges as an antidote to these illusive structures. This central figure is suddenly recognizable as a flat or three dimensional shape. Whether in dense black or highlighted as a central white figure, it is a condensation point, a place for our mind to rest. The images combine the icons of this escape but also serve as a visual guide to achieving it.\n\nWe are reminded of what art can offer us—mental freedom. Yet ultimately this is an illusion. Just as the opera is a staged fiction with its own rules and schedule, this composition is not real; it is a staged performance specifically created to evoke this reaction.", "imageUrl": "https://meta.tonic.xyz/logo.jpg"},

The latent spaces (the algorithmic structures that make AI image synthesis possible) can be seen as a part of our human collective unconsciousness; a hyper dimensional field of unlimited outcomes, inspired by our human symbols and language.\n\nExploring this new type of space, it sparked the idea of exploring the algorithmic essence of my own artworks. What would the structure behind my creative processes look like? What if I could visualize the algorithmic structures of my own mind that produced my artworks in the past?\n\nThese questions led me to The Field, a multidimensional machine hiding in my subconscious.\n\n# THE GENERATOR\nThe first step to reach The Field, was to capture the algorithmic structure behind all my artworks. By compressing several hundred artworks from HyperHash, EnergySculpture, UltraWave & HashCrash into a 64X64 matrix, a noise image has been created. This was done by adding up all these works together.\n\nThis noise image I call The Generator was the starting point to explore possibilities for the creation of a new work. This 64x64 matrix filled with noise data was embedded in the source of the piece and functions as the core of The Field algorithm.\n\n# THE FIELD\nThe Generator is being transformed into a multidimensional field of colors and motion, called The Field. The motions of the field relate to natural processes of creation and destruction. The field is like a fluid, solid and gas-like structure at the same time. It goes from a noisy formless state to a solid material state and back.\n\nThe field is created in a few steps. First a 2d noise pattern is being created from The Generator. This 2d pattern is made by picking random points from the 64x64 matrix. This is the fundamental background of the Field.\n\nThe second step is to use this pattern to set the field in motion. By using the color data per pixel, movement is being initiated. The colors are in that sense multifunctional, on one hand it visualizes random colors extracted from The Generator on the other hand the colors are used to set the field in motion and showing the interrelationship between the colors in an extra dimension: time. This creates the 3D effects, but also creates the effect of lighting bouncing in the field.\n\n\n# REGRESSION, DESTRUCTION & CREATION\nThe creation of the field felt for me like a form of regression. Reviewing the concepts of my previous work, thinking about what overlapped in terms of topics conceptually and design wise drew me back in time.\n\nThe main topic of this work represents is the cyclical nature of creation and destruction. By revisiting my old works and literally destroying them, this new work was created. In this way the work reflects on the causal relation between creation and destruction (what's created will someday be destroyed, something has to be created to be destroyed). A  universal essence of our causal reality behind all that is, a balance between forces, from light to dark, from warm to cold, from dry to wet, from finite to infinite.\n\nThis theme of creation and destruction is visible quite literally in The Field.

As the grandson of two artists who worked in the mediums of printmaking, paper cutting, and quilt making, I strive to incorporate the qualities of these mediums into my stipple-based digital paintings.\n\nAdditional approaches are pulled from my abstract experimentation in \"Dot Matrix Gradient Study\" with distortion and \"digital misprinting\" applied to the stipple matrices, but with a return to a figurative form.\n\nPalettes used in \"Sonoran Roadways\" are largely inspired by Arizona's scenic drives and fantastical multi-colored sunsets – peaceful and familiar to me. \n\n\"Sonoran Roadways\" is a call to appreciate the potentially mundane, and get lost in the imagination of the journey back to somewhere called home or the fantasy of an exploration to somewhere new.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Isj-RJyheJVO2Uw0NppmdwoPUFY2KrqiqZaKyI4lZFoRCJs4lKjWqItrPLt5IWIbsrNjWx508Q4Y1nuhy3Jw0wWIeGtUHQ3fdk"},

Witnessing the vast fields of yuccas flowering simultaneously and watching the sunrise over Judd's 100 untitled works in mill aluminum are two specific moments that will never leave my memory. Combining these two sensations resulted in generative arrangements of yuccas and boxes.\n## Edge of the desert\nThe city of Marfa is on the northeast side of the Chihuahuan desert. The weather is dry and hot in the summer. Plants that grow naturally in the region, like the yucca, have adapted well to the harsh conditions.\n## Soaptrees\nIn the Americas, there are a lot of different types of yucca. The type of yucca that grows in and around Marfa is called yucca elata, which is also known as the soaptree yucca. These yuccas grow very slowly, only about an inch per year. Yucca elata doesn't always bloom, but when it does, the flowers come out between May and June.\n## Sunrise at Chinati\nThe Chinati Foundation is a museum in Marfa based on Donald Judd's ideas. The focus is on works that have a strong connection to the land around them. Sometimes a special event called \"Sunrise at Chinati\" is held at the museum so that people can see the many works in the golden light of the morning sun.\n# An SVG is available!\nThe SVG is a fully scalable resolution agnostic version of the image.

Connected together and surrounding us on all sides, their framings and displays have also opened, activated, and added another spatiotemporal dimension to the four in which all of us live.*\n—Vivian Sobchack, *From Screen-Scape to Screen-Sphere: A Meditation in Medias Res*\n\nAn exploration of a technical concept I call \"pixel overpainting.\"\n\nRasterized procedural brush strokes with low transparency slowly layer themselves over each other in a rhythmic loop until they achieve colorful equilibrium. They continue to overpaint themselves endlessly. The resulting color mixtures are then quantized and dithered to separate them into patches of pixels that recall the discrete materiality of the screen: a strictly digital variation on color field painting. The resulting texture is not a skeuomorphic grain but an overt reference to the universe of screens that surround us every day. Electric light arranged in a grid, fluttering and flickering everywhere all the time.\n\nPlease allow a few minutes for the colors to reach equilibrium.\nFor best results use Chrome browser with enabled webGL and hardware acceleration. Though it is encouraged to explore the subtleties in viewing the same pixels on different hardware and software to reflect on the subjectivity of contemporary computer graphics and the materiality of CPUs, GPUs, resolutions, pixel densities, browser APIs, and other medium-specific entropy.\n\nPress '1', '2', '4', '8' to change pixel sizes.\nPress 'p' or click canvas to pause/resume.\nPress 's' to grab a still frame.\nPress 'r' to re-paint.\n\nCollectors will be eligible to receive a signed giclée print of a still frame of their mint as well as high-resolution looping media in GIF or lossless video format.\n```\n░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░\n```", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gLEQR-c0H7YLtkUXpBOhzMCGE7QncMcWVdEiHT6do3QAFCKURU_TUp5P9megPjnrq0D9uO58d5qSFRuwhIjRY7RH287xu3qzJL9Y"},

Go to the center to close the interference. Go to the edges to open it.\nDouble click change mode (Auto - Tactil )\n\nINTERFERENCES is about reordering the elements, altering the parts that make up the shapes and identifying the possibilities of color ordering.\nHere, the variability is found in the subtle, seeking to challenge the sensitive vision of the viewer, generating displacement effects, or simply proposing a minimal visual design.\n\nInterferences is an excuse to return to color theories from the Bauhaus and Latin American cinetics artist, that made up the artistic avant-garde of the 1950s. From there, the project seeks to continue developing on the relative characteristics of color: those situations in which our experience of the color changes according to the context. How to use color? It's not what colors, but how colors are used that define artists.\n\nThe instability appears as a game in the work on the form, breaking out the circle as a standard of harmony and perfection. How far can you continue to recognize a shape? It is this instability that suggests movement, like a photograph of a moment in the sequence, waiting to be completed.\n\nWhat characteristics does the work of art of web3.0 must have? That was one of the questions that motivated this work. There could be several answers, but I think one of them would definitely have to do with the possibility of change: is not a jpg, is not a .mov: it is a piece of software that you can touch and modify, find new possible outputs and play with variability.\n\nInterferences is a project of #purevisibility: there is no message.

The artist was spending those days creating artwork for what became Async Art's very first programmable artwork, \"First Supper.\" Among his creative contributions to this artwork including his greenish skinned \"Visionary Spirit of Creation,\" Kane collaborated with fellow artist Mlibty on assets for \"I AM THE TABLE,\" an NFT that Kane claims to still possess. Kane explains, \"This particular design went unminted because collaborating with Alotta Money made me extremely insecure about my own Adobe Photoshop skills. Mine were pebbles to his mountain. We were just getting to know one another through the process of this collaboration. In the Discord, I shared my dank design of stacked ETH coins, and asked if anyone with better Photoshop skills wanted to collab on the legs. I didn't directly ask him, not wanting to burden him as I knew he was very busy with CryptoVoxel commissions. My lapse to ask became all the more silly as we became fast friends as the First Supper collaboration continued. With no volunteers, I decided to leave that extra design out of the original table NFT for First Supper. Three years later, when Conlan and Nate reached out to me and explained the concept of Forever Supper, I instantly thought of this unminted table. I've always regretted not including this design in the original table NFT, but as I've come to learn in life, time tends to reveal greater purpose for our pasts.\"\n\nMINTING THE UNMINTED: 128 variations represent the 128 coins in the original unminted table design: 32 ETH stacked in each leg to represent the required amount to stake a node on the Ethereum blockchain. Like a table, staking is to become the solid foundation on which everyone working on the Ethereum blockchain depends on. It's my hope that that the artwork's variations become ways for collectors to represent their own values as they trade and update their Forever Supper cores to reflect their sentiment toward Ethereum and the market at any given time.\"\n\nGENERATIVE: \"I wrote an algorithm in Processing to stack the coins which make up the legs of the table. Using the concept of the Fear & Greed Index, 50 is the most stable. 0 being the most fearful contains the greatest weaknesses in the structure. 100, being the most greedy has the coins wobbling, almost dancing as greed threatens to unstake the coins to be cashed in. In order to create the unique cover art for each variation, I repurposed an algorithm I was originally working with in early 2020 that I created to test the limits of Async Art in those early days. On a whole, this is a loving tribute to a period of time that has grown to carry meaning into the future for a global audience, as we all continue building and learning.\"\n\nThis is an Expansion Pack for Forever Supper, the biggest cryptoart collaboration.

Going out to the deepest point where I could still tippy-toe touch, I felt a large, smooth rock with my feet. I could barely dig it out and bring it to the surface. [That rock](https://express.adobe.com/page/yTCRoiQjChyRe/#rock) is still with me. I once thought I lost it. Six months later, I found it in the trunk of my car. I threw a party to celebrate its return, but it was just us two.\n\nThe rocks you see here are not my rock. They are not rocks. They are not even images of rocks. They're code. But does that matter? If I were to show and ask you \"What is this?\", you'd probably say \"It's a rock\". So then, what is it? The title and imagery borrow from René Magritte's paintings [Treachery of Images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images) and [The Castle of the Pyrenees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_of_the_Pyrenees). Like those paintings, *This is Not a Rock* acts as a gateway to introspection and encourages the viewer to question what they are looking at while thinking about the interplay between object, representation, and truth.\n\n*This is Not a Rock* continues my exploration into Quines (software which outputs its own source code). In the scene, a large rock hovers, defying gravity. Behind the rock, a backdrop of computer code; combining the digital and the physical. The code you see is is the actual code used to generate the scene. It is all created inside a single-pass fragment shader with Javascript and GLSL, and rendered using a technique called Raymarching.\n\nKeyboard Commands:\nPress [L] to save an image.\nPress [Z] to zoom in/out.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/9b322f26826c3c239c0800d99049aff3.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

It is an enigma. Once solved, it is also a gateway.\n\nCrypt is a multilayered piece of generative art, one that unfolds into something else, then unfolds again. It contains artworks within artworks, found by puzzles inside other puzzles. One leading to another. At the center is a gateway. The gateway opens another world. That world is an Alternate Reality Game filled with cryptic histories, untold stories, and physical treasures hidden all over the world. \n\nTo begin, some hints. The solution to the first puzzle is a three-part key. It leads to another layer. Here is a room of sorts. An escape room. Viewable from three angles. In the room are eight code-words. They lead to the way out. Collaboration is essential.\n\nAt the bottom of Crypt is another key. It unlocks a world. It unlocks Cyclops.\n\nTo confirm your solution to crypt and claim your reward please visit: https://cyclopsgroup.art\n\n***Cyclops***\n\nCyclops is a networked performance, collaborative narrative, and alternate-reality-game designed to be played by groups of people working together across the world. Set in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the game begins with a series of audio tracks. Some tracks are musical compositions, others are filled with odd voices reading letters and counting numbers, others still resemble nothing more than noise and static.\n \nEach track is, in fact, a puzzle of increasing complexity. As players work together to solve them, a narrative about early research into psychological operations, mind-control experiments, and an alternative history of the internet age begins to emerge. Over the course of the game, players come across - and are invited to collect - a series of artworks specifically created for Cyclops players. To find these artworks, players must identify and follow up on clues provided within the game. Cyclops is a world within a world.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rYZ6byNbCZTi4Z4YJYu3dSW3noR44pA1u1bGFrDHVpLVtVqLNxE7N5oK2VZ2dz7wn-_yw4ulMwnAOLkhlseNE1acqM3Kddh_8R8"},

There are only interpretations._\n\nGlass is about the illusion of simplicity that cocoons us in our everyday existence. A glance at Glass may suggest a foam of bubbles or pebbles under clear water. But on inspection, these simple pictures dissolve. Instead of disks one finds stacked panes of translucent glass, intersecting and overlapping. There is dissonance between fine-scale chaos and the harmony of the aggregate. In Glass, two levels of reality -- panes of glass and the foam of bubbles -- are brought close together in scale, so that our oversimplified impression yields a palpable disquiet.\n\nWhat appears simple is often anything but. Consider a standard wooden desk. To our eyes, it looks solid and continuous, but we know that it is made of atoms, tiny electrons orbiting nuclei. And these subatomic particles are themselves not like miniature solar systems, but creatures of quantum mechanics, stranger than we can imagine. The vast difference in scale between the atomic and the macroscopic hides this complex reality, but fundamentally it is the same phenomenon shown here.\n\nGlass continues my exploration of emergence. While in previous work I explored how simple systems can create complex, emergent forms, here the interest is in the converse: how coherence is often deceptive, masking a complex underlying reality.\n\nGlass draws on the aesthetic of Shin Hanga artists Hiroshi Yoshida and Kawase Hasui, and abstract expressionist Sonja Sekula. In live view, Glass has ambient motion: the shadows evolve, imperceptibly slowly.\n\nThe following variations & controls are possible. You may need to click on the canvas before they are active. For a high-resolution output, use the pixel density controls. For example, on a standard laptop, an image saved at pixel density 5 will be approximately 3200 x 4000 pixels, and therefore suitable for printing at ~ 11\" x 13\" at 300 dpi.\n\nVariations (require redrawing):\n\nf -- fit-to-screen on/off\no -- outline on/off\n\nControls:\n\ns   -- save as png\nspacebar  -- pause/unpause ( useful to reduce CPU load in Live mode )\nb -- border on/off ( useful for printing )\n1-9  -- set pixel density (default=2 on retina displays)\n+/-  -- increase/decrease pixel density", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lY45xy95wVah0ggajJ7XMaNgfFEHEADIKEhTaHGIlAfIsLbZJ97US5asFQTkAlikPFeOUZ18GttYLNSc6HAx9UR1X5_RVVAaRBk"},

Dive into stacks of deterministic layers to explore emerging patterns, and fine-tune the audio reactivity to your preferences.  \n\nYou may wish to use the controls to wander within Divergence until the aesthetic feels right to you, or complements your audio input.  Navigating the art in this way gives a tangible window into my artistic process.  My aesthetic is influenced by the music I listen to as I code. I enjoy experimenting and looking for the art in the algorithm.  This can mean playing with overarching ideas, but also making many small changes until I find consistent visual appeal over a range of outputs.  \n\nDivergence exhibits animations changing over time in expanding, textural layers.  It elaborates on concepts I’ve developed in previous works: my approach to color in phase; linear motion in Parade; interlacing lines and expansion/contraction in Kaleidoscope; and the noise textures of Sift.  Newly explored is continuous animation with touch and audio inputs, which affect the viewing position in time and space.  \n\nA common quip in the Art Blocks community is that motion art has a penalty. Many enjoy a final product that is printable to frame at home.  As technology advances, I believe it is equally important to create work that can only exist on a screen, and is unique to digital art. Larger displays are catching up to the artistic space and becoming more accessible, but I also want my work to be approachable immediately.  Keeping the code lean and performant allows it to run well on a range of screen sizes and processor powers, from mobile devices to multi-story displays.  There has been discussion that a body of motion work takes a long time to sift through, as it needs to be viewed live.  In consideration of this, I made Divergence immersive, rather than a static experience. I want the extra time spent with it to be fun and entertaining.  \n\nUsage: Navigate left/right to traverse the timeline; navigate up/down to travel through the layers and expand/contract the patterns.  Please see “Display Notes” for further instructions (user input, audio reactivity, url parameters).  Accessibility is important to me, so Divergence accepts inputs from touch, keyboard, mouse, and gaming controllers with an analog stick.  \n\n*Photosensitive seizure warning: These artworks contain flashing colors and moving patterns.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/eda0dc121335f246d052bac60dfa18ac.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

They are used widely in architecture, product design, and perhaps most familiarly in user interfaces. Think: desktop icons like trash cans or notepads. SKEUOMORPHS is a meditation on this digital tradition. \n\nSKEUOMORPHS picks up where RASTER left off as an another exploration of the materiality of pixels and rasterized imagery. Here the study of pixels narrows in on the shallow depth of on-screen interfaces and the play of low-res figure-ground effects. Moments of skeuomorphism where the 2-dimensional plane of the screen becomes slightly 3-dimensional through beveling or drop-shadows are extracted and used as abstract painterly details. These elements that are typically used to make computation and interfaces more familiar become unfamiliar on the canvas, suggesting the possibility of an aesthetic between abstraction and realism.\n\nSKEUOMORPHS employs recurring themes and techniques from my art practice: limited color palettes, low-res chunky pixels, dithering, and physics simulation. It uses a specific kind of dithering called R-sequence dither developed by Martin Roberts. Like traditional Bayer matrix-based dithering, this technique produces a patterned image akin to retro video games and early computer screens. In this project, the R-dither pattern results in a woven textile-like texture, which recalls the long relationship between computing and weaving. The canvas negotiates two scales simultaneously: that of the dithered pixel (rendered at 1/1024th of the canvas height) and the simulated particle that acts as a brush stroke (rendered at 1/256th of the canvas height).

From the early days in his photo darkroom, I learned that photography is all about creating connections. My father Heinz Hosch was my icon.

He was my first teacher and I lost him at the age of 52. He was not killed in these wars but in the end I believe it was the wars that killed him. On March 11th, I was able to celebrate my 52nd birthday, the age he was when he so unexpectedly passed away in 1981. This is when I made a decision that would change the course of my life: I would keep his cameras, become a photographer, and continue his legacy. “52icons” is a personal collection of 1/1 portraits that capture some of the most famous faces of our time, including my father, forever in my heart and now forever living on the blockchain.

I vividly recall a childhood trek up Mt. Fuji with my parents through a foggy bamboo forest, and the image of my dad buying a walking stick from an older vendor. But as my mom later clarified, the adventure actually took place in a Tokyo park –– I’ve never even visited Fuji-san. Contemplating this blend of the real and the imagined has led me to create generative vistas whose clarity is eroded by the passing of time.\n\n\nThe landscapes in Recollection are understated and familiar: rolling hills, distant mountains, and sporadic clusters of trees or forests. There is a path through grass and stone –– sometimes clear but, at other times, overgrown and obscure. Many of these paths culminate at a portal, its purpose enigmatic. It is pure mystery, both inviting and unsettling. It is an obscuring void, a memory half-recalled.\n\nRecollection is a meditation on the mysteries of the mind, and a tribute to the quest for understanding. It stands not only as a beacon of hope for those grappling with the disintegration of memory, but also a testament to the enduring pursuit of clarity in the midst of obscurity. While some details may fade with time, the essence — the emotions, the lessons, the significance — has the potential to regenerate through reflection, conversation, and creative expression.\n\n\nRecollection is part of the reGEN initiative for Alzheimer’s research. For many, this cause is deeply personal and, I believe, it is no exaggeration to say that almost everyone has witnessed the effects of Alzheimer’s, be it within their own family or through friends.

Can we converse with creative energy? Artists throughout history have posed such questions. When I start creating new generative artwork, I often focus on discovering what’s new that I might unearth within the exploration of a simple algorithm. When the visual outputs start to move me, I love the idea that perhaps I’ve discovered some sort of personality hidden within the confines of the code, waiting for the most unlikely parameter to unlock its emergent beauty. Within that creative journey, I have a hidden agenda. I hope to commune with the voices hiding inside the code. \n\n*Speak To Me* experiments with layering and interrupting repetitions of basic geometric shapes, exploring their interplay and movement when placed in relation to one another. Drawing loose inspiration from historic art movements such as Suprematism and Constructivism, I’m seeking to investigate the potential of these simple forms to create dynamic and complex visual arrangements. The code generates compositions that are both structured and organic, imparting a movement and energy to the shapes, so they seem to grow and flow like living organisms. Some shapes speak boldly, with clear, directional vision. Some embrace the space between. Within this collection, the differences in those voices are celebrated with intention. \n\nOne night I dreamed of my code in progress, which sometimes happens when I’m immersed in a project. I awoke in the middle of the night with a specific phrase running through my head, got up to groggily scribble it onto some paper, then fell back to sleep. In the morning, I woke up to see the words “Speak To Me”, and I realized that I now had the name of my collection, imparted in a dream.\n\nThroughout the creation of *Speak To Me*, I found myself wondering if there might be a secret life of shapes. Reflecting on the creative process, I firmly believe that there is a dynamic energy inherent in artistic creation that can be considered a life force. As an artist, I view my role as a conduit and facilitator for this energy to manifest in the physical realm. From this perspective, in the case of generative art, I open up the role of creator to share with both the generative randomness of the algorithm and the creative force that inspires its creation. By embracing this philosophy of artistic creation, I’m hoping to both experience and share a more profound and transformative creative journey. I hope this artwork speaks to you as it has to me.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NjnoulfFLv2yKl-7MNnnVJqQ1iKEtqJiOCgGdVg6_w_gX9PIclSl9KAld_0QhOSZIPAK-1zWP2iFXuwbtjywDeOEWif6qYREzA"},

In projects that involve tracking down covert CIA operations, analyzing NSA surveillance programs, or dissecting harmful AI systems, I’ve always been interested in the numerous methods humans have developed to hide secrets and the ingenious ways others have created to expose them.\n \nFor the PRELUDES works, I challenged myself to think about how one could hide secrets using the particularities of an entirely on-chain medium. While the blockchain’s underlying technology, of course, relies on the same types of cryptography used by intelligence agencies, secure banking systems, and other entities, the question of how to hide something in a medium where everything is visible poses a particular type of problem. I went back to my early training as a composer to find an answer.\n \nThe PRELUDES NFTs are musical compositions that hide secrets. On one hand, they’re inspired by the pioneers of algorithmically generated music such as John Cage and Iannis Xenakis.

Launching June 26, in sync with the annual Rhizome Gala benefit, the SEED journey will highlight key artistic moments from the earliest days of the genre, using Rhizome's rich archive of digital artworks, exhibitions and commissions.\n*Postcards from StarryNight* is an exclusive series of NFTs created from a restored version of an important early work of net art. Proceeds from this NFT will support Rhizome, a non-profit organization that has championed the cause of digital art since 1996. Mint it now, and this artwork will take root in your wallet and identify you to the world as a Rhizome supporter—and provide priority access to additional generative artwork collections launching this fall.

This saturation is often accompanied by a sense of disorientation and fragmentation, making it challenging to extract meaningful and valuable insights. As humanity progresses and evolves, this gap between our biological, cognitive, and perceptual capacities and the rapid advancements of our digital world becomes increasingly significant.\n\nInfinity, chaos, complexity, self-reproducibility, coherence, and layering are epithets that apply to this work.\n\nThis artwork seeks to capture the complexity and chaos of our digital existence, utilizing various visual techniques to convey its message. Layering and fragmentation visually depict the scattered and fragmented nature of our digital lives, with each layer representing a different unit of information. This fragmentation is further underscored by the grid of \"transport\" lines that permeate the canvas, symbolizing the interconnected networks and corporations that seek to control and manipulate our attention. Despite the strict rules governing the forms in the artwork, the overall effect is one of chaos and impending tragedy. This tension between order and disorder is a recurring theme, conveying that we are on the brink of losing control and being consumed by information overload. The visual elements of the artwork convey a \"technological coldness\" and emotionlessness, reflecting the detachment that can result from our immersion in the digital realm. Some of the elements are unfocused, which creates the effect of discomfort and the inability to concentrate and embrace all the available space at once. A kind of frame is the \"traces\" of data gathering toward the center - in our minds - and intertwining into an endless tangle of something massive and noisy but with no precise shape.\n\nTo reinforce the concept, I placed an infinite rotation of all the layers used in the art behind the main canvas. They alternate at great speed, constantly changing their \"compression\" and background, symbolizing the endless flow of digital information overwhelming our consciousness.\n\nThrough its visual elements and composition, the artwork urges us to reflect on our collective responsibility to engage with technology more ethically and thoughtfully. It reminds us that while technology can offer many opportunities and benefits, it also significantly challenges our values and ethics. In this sense, the artwork serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining a balance between technological progress and human values.\n\nI used many techniques to create this art. Because of the large number of generated elements and big canvas size, it takes quite a long time to make, \"overloading\" your device and then entirely using its resources, which is also part of the concept.\n\n---\n\nThis art is static until you touch it. You can use the mouse wheel to examine the details, and you can also drag the surface of the art. Also, this art is created in two parts.

As the layers all possess some level of transparency, light passes through the paint, hitting the canvas and reflecting back toward the viewer. This creates an otherworldly, glowing, living effect that is inimitable by any other means. The nature of the technique requires a tremendous amount of time--the more glazes, the more rich and beautiful the effect--and is very unforgiving of mistakes. The artist that dedicates to this slow, careful, path--to return, again and again, layer after layer, week after week--will bring a rare and singular beauty into the world.\r\n\r\n*This collection features an Open Edition, a 24-hour [1/1 Auction](https://www.niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x464436fa5a31b0923922d56d6e755e53927260b6/1), a [100 edition FCFS](https://www.niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x464436fa5a31b0923922d56d6e755e53927260b6/2) (for previous collectors only), and an exclusive [airdrop](https://www.niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x464436fa5a31b0923922d56d6e755e53927260b6/3) (for Claire Silver's 1/1 holders).

They are the farthest man crafted objects from Earth. It will take tens to hundreds thousands years for them to reach other stars and planetary systems despite a velocity of 17km/s... \nThe on-board camera, mysteriously, sends back images of the remote planets and their moons...\n\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\nDylan Thomas (Do not go gentle into that good night)\n\nARTWORK DESCRIPTION\n\nThe artwork represents a planet and its moons. There is an important variety of planet/moons types, different perspectives (far or near the planet and moons), different space environments (stars, Milky Way, star clusters,  comet, eclipse, Einstein cross and ring, Magellanic Clouds...). A very rare Gravitational Wave affecting space properties can occur. Usually Monochromatic, there is a variation with the addition of one color. In \"live view\" use the interaction possibilities to explore a given planetary system...\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\n\nIn the same way photons hit the CCD camera, tiny squares hit the canvas.\nThe algorithm is minimalist : pick a random position in the canvas and decide if a monochromatic tiny square has to be drawn or not (rarely, squares can be drawn in 2 colors). The light parts are drawn only through the absence of drawing. The whole complexity resides in the decision to draw or not to draw. Mathematical functions are underneath each decision, like space and time are underneath all of our world. \n\n\nINTERACTIONS\n\nYou can interact with keyboard commands or through URL parameters.\n- press S : to save the current image in png\n- press 2, 3... 9 (URL, add DP=2) : change resolution. Increase the value step by step. Can be very long to draw, but it's worth it for printing. Very High Resolution can be achieved. The file is saved automatically when finished.\n- press L (URL, add liveMode=true) : to discover different views of your planetary system (images will be drawn one after the other, with the same parameters for the main planet and the space environment).\n- press F (URL, add fitToScreen=true) : to adapt the artwork to any screen size (artwork is changed but parameters remain the same)\n- press M (URL, add monoChromatic=true) : to force the artwork to be monochromatic\n- press G (URL, add GW=false) : to remove the gravitational wave effect\n- URL, add offset=<Number>, to offset the image production (same planet parameters and space environment)\n- URL, add grainy=true, to change the size of the grain (useful for displays to speed up the creation process)\n\nURL Parameters are added to the end of a URL after a ‘?’ symbol, and multiple parameters can be included when separated by the ‘&’ symbol.\nYou can combine \"?liveMode=true&fitToScreen=true&grainy=true\" in the URL for display purpose (TV, Art show...). \nCombining liveMode and DP for resolution allows you to save all the images produced.\n\n\nEXTERNAL LICENSE\n\nVoyager is built with p5js and a simplex noise library under MIT license: simplex-noise.js.\n\n\nDISRUPTED STAR\n\nI am a French astrophysicist (PhD) working in high energy astrophysics.\nMy artist name is related to an astrophysical event in which a star, a pretty common object in the Universe,  comes too close to a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH), is torn apart and finally tidally disrupted...\nThe Generative Art plays the role of the SMBH that has changed my life in many ways in the past years...", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/e9cfd42799ba7ae5f495bb8158faa265.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

Inspired by starling murmurations, the repetition of a line, dot, or ring forms a flock of flickering particles rippling across the canvas. Interconnected audio and visual patterns create a mesmerizing display of echoes and modulations. As the sound expands and contracts, so do the areas of visual density, revealing ephemeral shapes and structures. Sounds become visible. Visuals become audible.\n\nWithin the sonic component, filters and echoes manipulate a sustained chord until subtle melodies and rhythmic structures appear, resulting in a hypnotic and evolving soundscape unfolding from an elementary source. The signal path relies solely on bespoke code built using Web Audio, including an implementation of an early computer music algorithm called *Karplus-Strong* which utilizes tuned delay lines to simulate the physics of stringed instruments. The audio effect design is also inspired by the magical warmth of vintage analog equipment like tape loop echo units. This analog quality found its way into the visual style: the low frame rate gives the project a hand animated feel reminiscent of stop motion.\n\nOn our last album, [Still](https://silentseason.bandcamp.com/album/still), we questioned the repetitive experience of pedestrian life, attempting to invoke wonder in the constantly evolving nature of our world, even in moments of perceived stillness. *l.o* expands this line of inquiry, inviting the audience to appreciate the compounding complexity surfacing from a succession of small shifts within a fixed pattern. As the series builds, various directions of color, shape, tone and tempo are unveiled.\n\nAlongside works like *Flux* by Owen Moore, or *montreal friend scale* by Amon Tobin, the project explores core questions about the audiovisual medium: can it be more than visuals in the service of sound, or sound in the service of visuals? How can the synthesis of the two media create a richer whole? While the sound of *Flux* reacts to visual data, and *montreal friend scale* is a literal visual representation of a sonic concept, *l.o* features a two-way dialogue between sound and visuals. The two are interconnected through 9 different paths, including a key relationship where filter frequency modulates flock density (more details available in the [AV section](https://l.o.night-sea.com/#av) of the project’s website). This audiovisual conversation offers a unique encounter between generative visual art and abstract electronic music, two vibrant spaces that share a common thread.\n\nKey controls are available to explore the different components building the final sound:\n\n- Press ‘0’ to turn off all effects and hear the initial sustained chord\n- Press ‘1’ to toggle back on / off the amplitude modulation (can sound subtle in certain outputs)\n- Press ‘2’ to toggle back on / off the filtering effects\n- Press ‘3’ to toggle back on / off the echo based effects\n- Press ‘Space’ to pause / resume the piece\n\nAfter pressing ‘0’, pressing successively ‘1’, ‘2’ and ‘3’ will bring the piece back to the original audio setup.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fDCRUjlRLABYcrlEMvBYIVL7KaggfOLVU8tjRF1ZIE01QrvjlVQc2Qot1iov25E3VhSfPX01ER50sYY4ewv4U14fvSupsDfY0ak"},

At times, one can experience their private, most expansive self as their true self. In other moments, a performative cutout is needed to conform to one’s environment. Through its various manifestations, the work dwells on the tension between displaying the private self as a form of liberation, and amplifying the performative self as a form of suppression.\n\nThe collection draws inspiration from my childhood as an Indian-American growing up in Atlanta, where I felt pressure to conform to the cultural norms and expectations of those around me.

Thanks for teaching me its true meaning.\n6. This is for you, More. With love and gratitude, S.\n\n**Intimità**, Stefano Contiero's latest collection, explores the themes of intimacy and discovery. The work emphasizes uncovering the deeper aspects of our relationships and suggesting that genuine, meaningful connection can only be fully experienced when the veil of surface appearances is lifted.\n\nBuilding a relationship is often considered a process of construction, where two individuals come together to form a bond. However, the process can also be seen as deconstruction, where both partners must tear down the walls they have built around themselves, exposing their vulnerabilities and allowing themselves to be known.\n\nContiero's works feature open fields of color that melt together to create an effect reminiscent of marbling. Vibrant hues are subtly aged with a patina, enhancing each piece's visual impact and giving it a sense of depth and movement. Through Contiero's striking compositions, he invites us to consider the role physical and emotional obstacles play in shaping our experiences of intimacy. Only through time and deep exploration can these barriers be removed.", "imageUrl": "https://meta.tonic.xyz/logo.jpg"},

Hold on! Hold on!\nI like to think of my brain as a hand,\npalm of my soul, fragile nerve bundle.\nI think about my brain as I hold my heart\nin both hands — a private thing, a pulsing secret.\nIt fills my palms and bones with heat.\nThe world is full of heartbeat.\nI am trying to hold it all together...*\n    &nbsp; -- &nbsp;Excerpt from *STILL MOVING*, by Technelegy\n\n**NOTE: To fully experience *STILL MOVING*, please open in LIVE VIEW and enable your webcam for motion tracking.**\n\nThe first project of its kind, *STILL MOVING* is an interactive poem about humanity’s visceral engagement with the virtual – written and published via the blockchain as a token word performance, and embodied by each collector as a uniquely intimate, personalized interpretation. In this epic on-chain ode to the relationship of bodies and machines, literal and figurative wordplay activates the liminal space between text and reader, extending the two-dimensional screen/page into a somatic, material realm where language moves us in every sense of that phrase – up, down, sideways, forwards, backwards, and in otherwise inexpressible directions – urging us to reclaim our dynamism and intuitive physicality in an age of technological acceleration, bodily inertia, and rote gestures.\n\nA collaboration between Nathaniel Stern and Sasha Stiles – rooted in Stiles’ AI-powered verse and Stern’s career in digital, interactive, and networked art – *STILL MOVING* is an ars poetica about what it means to be a human body facing a machine: a showdown, a form of worship, a distraction, a mirror gaze, an other, an alter, an alter. After we bend to our technologies, do we spring back into shape, or assume new forms? Where does input end, and output begin? As we continue to think, work, and play faster than ever while rooted in place, it is still possible to be moved – *really* moved?\n\n*STILL MOVING* also embodies the future of web3 literature, in which the book – read-only – evolves into a read-write-interact experience, and authors begin to adopt such tools as webcams and NFTs in their writerly arsenal. In each unique edition of *STILL MOVING*, camera-based motion tracking (data confined to your local machine only) facilitates a play-full and meaning-full interface between the reader’s physical self and language on screen. Human forms and gestures shape machine expression, and vice versa, cybernetic serendipity inspires poetic association. Make a move, and be moved… Stand still, and instill meaning…\n\nPalettes pair paper, charcoal, and pencil colorings – emblematic of the stationery/stationary – with neon and electric highlights that nod to computational restlessness. Preview images feature lines from the core poem, potent standalone phrases, or rare, gestural graphics and images, caught somewhere between language and illustration, expression and wordless apprehension. \n\n\n**FUNCTIONS**\n\n*Click inside the interaction area if any of the function keys below are not working.*\n\n*Space Bar* to toggle Play/Pause the interaction and animation\n\n*'d'* Downloads the current image at the screen/browser resolution\n\n*Up/Down arrows* increase/decrease camera sensitivity by 5\n(for use in high and low light situations;\n0-150, default is 90; higher numbers = more text)\n\n*Top two keyboard rows (numbers 1 thru 0 and letters q thru p)* also birth semi-mapped text\n\n*'c'* toggles Camera use (if present and on) between keyboard only or both\n\n*'v'* Views/hides the Verse (your poetry / your iteration’s text)\n\n*'f'* toggles Full screen (Live View only)\n\n*'s'* downloads / Saves the entire AI poem to the hard drive", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OfAs5WHwiE7AlYbqQfOG6xThpi5tj1t0q_0LHMSbFFKh_s7m310qpYXsvEiV8CeNopvhX0MqYxipevuUCQ6ra1qKbFL83oC2L-U"},

I started a slow introspection on the subject, and at the end of the year, I released “Foundations”, a series that focuses on the origins of our identity.\n\n“Tout tracé” is the second act, and its direct continuity. \nIn French, it means *“All mapped out”*, referring to the idea of an all planned future or *“a ready made path”.*\n\nThis series is the counterpoint of this vision. \n\nLife is full of surprises, good or bad, and each moment will have an impact on us, creating our set of experiences, many of them involuntary and embedded in our existence.\nAs humans, we are in constant evolution and therefore, on a quest of identity; of who we really are.\nWe are surrounded by expectations : from society, culture, religion, parents, friends, family… A list of rules that need to be followed and lived by; but, at the end of the day, I believe that only our choices matter.\n\nLike “Foundations”, the composition of “Tout tracé” is grid based: full of boxes expected to be filled.\nBut this series is about growth, evolution, expression and re-definition. It’s about fighting against the structure in place, finding our own voice and re-shaping our reality.\nIt is finding its uniqueness and identity that will be revealed through the millions of lines drawing each artwork, technically signing the idea of “Tout tracé”, that comes with a double meaning: *“All drawn”*.\n\n\n--\n- **Press ‘S’** to export a still image.\n- **Press ‘H’** to open a new tab of the artwork in HD (A3 format).\n\n-- \n\nOpening one output in fullscreen or in live view will run an animation revealing the artwork.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LGePFIF9DcSYNE5dSM2wnxL5DFBCHbJgUenWKVtubRYM9NdpIp6bC77KYFWGcz-77nZQiezIU4J3JDAuh4PiVtrwLdc6H9G77lE"},

These randomly generate simple musical timbres inspired by early computer sound chips. 🌴 The music itself is generated by randomly selecting 3 patterns out of a pool of 180. These patterns, which are little 8-bar music pieces, were written in the same C# Dorian scale so they always fit together. This is a pleasant sounding minor and colorful scale that I believe fits the general vibe of Rafaël’s work. 🌲 Composition wise, channel 1 plays the bassline and channels 2 and 3 the melody, countermelody, arpeggios and harmonies. 🌳 The system changes the patterns each time they are played, reversing, speeding up or slowing down the pattern or changing the synthesizer channel they are played on. In essence the system infinitely randomly remixes the source melodies to create ever new surprising pieces that harmonize with the colorful compositions.* 👈", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SBPdK2XmCqkfVW3aPmpHRf1aPu8cMti1Ol59w0H5tBJnWzLV7-gOqD-oM3enmZkbL7JkSUbnC6EN1kjW7ULBnQX9chIiFDpEew"},

A Seedling's natural environment–whether a grassy prairie, a rocky mountain, or by a river–is but a memory now, leaving a faded imprint on the canvas' outer border. Some Seedlings resemble trees and flowers, others may appear to be geometric abstractions and fractals–yet all feature interplay between filled patterned regions (leaves and petals) and lines of solid color (stems and branches). Other abstractions also make an appearance: circles representing fruits, stars, or the sun and moon; and a gradient sky with foggy clouds beyond the frames of the window.\n\n## Foundation\n\nThe idea for Seedlings was sown in 2019 and was my first foray into Generative Art. It began as a study of fractal trees where each depth level was individually parametrized (angle of rotation, length, etc.). Initially just a hobbyist project in the pre-Art Blocks era, I returned to Seedlings in 2022 to develop it into the longform series, I believe, that most effectively highlights the underlying algorithm's potential. So, I rewrote Seedlings from scratch, turning its simple monochromatic line renderer into a WebGL shader renderer capable of transforming Bézier curves into abstract stems, branches, leaves, and petals with diverse and colorful palettes.\n\n## Inspiration\n\nHaving lived much of my life in New York, one of the most urbanized cities in the world, I developed a significant appreciation for green spaces. The city's parks became a refuge from the urban sprawl–where one could touch some grass, breathe fresh air, and pretend they were somewhere else. In an attempt to fill more of my life with green, I placed some plants on my windowsill. The joy they bring my home inspired Seedlings.\n\nOver the course of its development, Seedlings collected many stylistic influences, including Hokusai's trees, Charles Demuth's crisscrossing polygonal regions, and Alphonse Mucha's curves. As such, you will find elements of Ukiyo-e and Art Nouveau across the collection. Seedlings also contains stylistic elements found in my other work, such as ink-like outlining and the concept of shape overlap.\n\nAdditionally, I drew inspiration from contemporary longform Generative Art that aims to create complex emergent behaviors from the interactions of a small set of primitives. The structural patterns that form each Seedling are created purely from the probabilistic placement of their branches and petals.\n\n## Dedication\n\nSeedlings has been a labor of love and has particular sentimental value to me as the inception of my Generative Art practice. It feels fitting and very exciting to be given the opportunity to release Seedlings on Art Blocks, the original longform Generative Art platform. Thank you to everyone who helped and supported me during this journey.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SRPGd5qhX37EGxDJT3mBlcVOrqRQVIq8XU-q9kachwE0LxNtig3X58b7WUJ7LP6rsH7cx7zpWpKzM_l7KlYUgN3nV5E5QkQ907Be"},

By referencing historical precedents, Flourish produces designs that exist between the past and present, striking a balance between tradition and innovation.\n\nFlourish’s logic uses a linguistic structure that treats simple shapes like an alphabet and arranges geometry into phrases, establishing and dissolving symmetries. This logic is similar to a formal grammar system with rules that describe how words can be combined to form sentences. As a very simple example, a rule for the English language might be that a noun phrase can be followed by a verb phrase. So, a person dances, a cat sleeps, a bird sings. In the context of Flourish, pentagons can be subdivided into triangles, which can be enclosed by circles to create complex patterns. As geometry is combined and rearranged, the linguistic-like structure of the image changes, which also changes the next possible sets of geometric operations.\n\nThe palettes reflect various eras and mediums, invoking the feeling of aged archival drawings, woodblock prints, freshly inked illustrations, blueprints, and photocopies. The images resemble photographs of drawings rather than the drawings themselves, creating the impression of a carefully archived collection of artifacts that document a history just now coming into existence.\n\nIn my own history, I spent many years filling notebooks with abstract flowing drawings using very fine pens while studying painting and drawing. I would start by making one small curved mark, and then make thousands more while following the natural rhythm that my hand and wrist made. The density of marks and careful variations of spacing gave the drawings a meditative quality. Flourish's fine flowing lines draw from this meditative practice, imbuing each image with a sense of careful attention and intention.\n\nThe best architecture is a harmony of the natural and the constructed. And so the fine detailed marks are meant to feel natural, and to build up the constructed geometries with an emergent natural foundation.\n\nManipulating the arrangement of primary shapes to create complex patterns is a hallmark of both generative design and traditional architectural design. Flourish exists somewhere between this relationship. Rather than taking the historical path of contemporary parametric architecture, with its large sweeping forms and sci-fi aesthetics, Flourish creates an alternative history, a revivalist rebirth of the roaring twenties for the 2020s.\n\n------\nPrints on archival paper will be made available at a later date.\n\nA percentage of profits from the primary sale will be donated to the Hawaii Community Foundation's Maui Strong Fund to support Maui residents affected by the wildfires.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/79a613560bd2b8f8976e0aa50ccfa150.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

The sculptural essence of transient life, how a moment of beauty defies everything forever in the moment.“ \r\n\r\nThe flower paintings have been a strand of Colbert’s practice for the last few years, Initially conceptually inspired by Warhol’s and reinvented within his unique digital world, as cactus flowers growing all over his metaverse.

As Schiller argued, \"Man is human only when he plays\", because that is when creative imagination is completely unleashed.\n\nIn this perspective, our focus shifted from the final result to the acts that generate it. Disregarding any specific purpose, we lost ourselves in stacking, assembling, colouring simple shapes, and then again destroying and rebuilding, just like we used to do in childhood. Fun and discovery in the process were the purpose. \n\nWhile playing, the idea of network with its nodes and connections became stronger and stronger, but only in its broadest sense. It could evoke the image of branched-chain amino acids as well as the prototype of a boardgame, or even the complex structure of an entire city, whose elements converse and exchange flows of any kind. The continuous oscillation between abstract and figurative corresponds to the continuous oscillation of meaning, just as it happens in the playful dimension.\n\nWe keep interpreting these images differently every time we look at them.

The project tells a story of the tragic end of all existence in a distant universe, long since forgotten. Any given individual output depicts a passing moment, captured during the final breath of each dying world. The once peaceful landscapes were torn apart, deforming and reshaping their natural geometries and thus the reality itself in a surrealistic fashion.\n\nEach image is drawn to vaguely mimic a pencil-like texture. Firstly to remind of something familiar and subsequently emitting a peculiar and eerie feeling. Did this event happen and was it witnessed by a carbon-based life-form?\n\nThe project invites the viewer to ponder the different scenarios of what might have transpired in the past that lead the universe to its doom. Although one interpretation can be deciphered from the partially corrupted transmission below, it is not necessarily the true explanation.\n\n\nThe only thing that is known, is that all life ceased to exist in this ancient universe long time ago. Its tale lives on, but only as a memory and as a reminder to us all that life can be fragile and fleeting, albeit beautiful and precious.\n\n## The Story\n\n*”If anyone listens .. …. recording …. ….. ….. .. a warning …. …. will happen .. your world. We didn’t …. …. .. our universe, ……. we drained … ….. resource ….. .. couldn’t sustain … life …. any longer. The great collapse .. moments away … this will .. … end .. our story. Do not …… our mistakes. Most importantly … …. prevent ….. …. ……… ….. world .. … ……. ……… at any cost. This is our final transmission.”*\n\nJust as the transmission ends, a sudden flash of dreamlike images flashes through your mind, leaving a vivid imprint. These were the final moments of an ancient, distant and long forgotten universe. The rush is too much to handle and you faint. You wake up and immediately start looking for the recording but it's gone. You remember everything as clear as day, but was it just a dream?\n\n## The Details\n\nThere are several main scenes, which depict the specific stage that the end has advanced to. The predominantly or entirely black and white and the muted palettes give a sense of silence and solitude. Meanwhile other palettes disturb that calmness. Some palettes remind of colors in nature, but most are chosen and used in unnatural manner touching the style of expressionism.\n\nPressing \"s\" saves a screenshot at any point during the rendering. Pressing \"p\" pauses and unpauses the rendering. Pressing up or down arrow increases or decreases the drawing animation speed.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/7c5741f4c487aae381bba2a2e1f11923.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

This sense of structure is something that holds true to most of us individuals, communities, nations. However disorganised or frail one may be on the inside one often makes a substantial effort to appear structured, ordered. In other words our orderliness stems from the perception of that very orderliness.\n\nThe themes explored in my work are often a bi-product of my echoic memory in which I often pick up on background movie dialogues and tend to remember them by associating a colour and feeling to them. This in turn becomes an artistic direction, drawing inspiration from the sets, colours, location, time period, soundtrack, language and so on. The soundbite and evoked emotions guide the exploration and creation process.\nMore often than not the line from the movie becomes the title for the piece, as is the case for _Such A Lovely Time_.\n\n_Such A Lovely Time_ has a number of simple traits that when combined create intricate compositions.\n- Three different styles (Grid, Punch Card and Mixed) set the foundation.\n\t- The Grid style is based on a simple grid of elements with varying levels of density.\n\t- While the Punch Card style is essentially also a grid, it has a different rhythm to it, at times very sparse with isolated clusters, at other times those clusters and elements are connected together almost resembling sheet music. In some instances the Punch Card can be very dense almost to the point of saturation.\n\t- The Mixed style is a blend of the two aforementioned and introduces a higher degree of variations and somewhat unexpected results.\n\n- There are 16 palettes, each one of them named after a city. The colours are extracted from personal travel photos to those cities before being fine tuned.\n\n- The Cyrillic glyph is the centre piece of the composition, sometimes bold and in the foreground, at times fragmented and sometimes even hidden, as if an invitation to the viewer to look closer and explore the many layered details.\n\n- The other traits that make up the piece may have less depth in their meaning but add to the overall amount of graphical variations.\n\nEach iteration of _Such A Lovely Time_ is a generative attempt at technical aesthetics.\n\nCreated by petitsapin (Dominique McKerl Dautheribes).", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/37694fafcf405da629306be51fec3b59.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

This creates a more immersive feel, gives the viewer control over the artwork and leverages what makes Artblocks unique by generating all the outputs entirely through code running live in the browser.\n\nIn all my work, I seek to blur the lines between the digital and the physical world by making 3D digital sculptures that feel (and look) like they could live in the physical world. That’s why with all my artworks I provide a way to visualize each interaction through Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality interfaces.\n\nIn this project I tried to utilize all the technical skills I acquired over the years and used a combination of 3D objects composition, custom grid layout, GLSL shaders, perlin noise and custom post processing all powered by ThreeJS.\n\nThe features give a wide variety of outputs and rarity while retaining a common visual language throughout the collection.\n\n---\n\n## Controls\nClick and drag to rotate the camera around the artwork.\nScroll to zoom the camera in and out.\n\n---\n\n## To View in AR\nGo to [jeanvascript.com/voxel/xr/](https://www.jeanvascript.com/voxel/xr/) on a WebAR compatible browser like Google Chrome on Android and [XRViewer](https://labs.mozilla.org/projects/webxr-viewer/) on iOS and click the \"AR\" button.\n\n## To View in VR\nGo to [jeanvascript.com/voxel/xr/](https://www.jeanvascript.com/voxel/xr/) on an WebVR compatible browser and device like the Meta Quest browser on Quest 2 and click the \"VR\" button.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WexfGWTYKAj_54Qjmn7BiT_j5J7F4JYcoidXcWQ9dmt_TbJ5JrHSQazBeV4U_CF02_iasuo0e5Ij2RoHntlba94jW4ncCWtGlrc"},

Pixel sorting is a procedure that isolates segments of pixels and sorts their positions based on any number of criteria (i.e. luminosity, hue, saturation). \n\nAssorted Positivity is a generative approach to making pixel sorting art without any photographic base. The algorithm uses several types of noise to generate an initial design, each one unique to the token and specifically conducive to pixel-sorting. The sorting displaces pixels in various directions based on their grayscale value; and hues determine how the sorting ends. Sometimes the sorting lends itself to a sort of drip look and other times it presents itself as depth and shading.\n\nThis project was initially influenced by my desire to sort past the ubiquitous negativity online and focus on the positivity, generosity, and genuine thoughtfulness that I have witnessed around this genart space--with collectors, artists, and people who simply appreciate the community.\n\nIntegrated into each piece is an uplifting adjective that is visible, yet blended into the art. At a glance, the viewer may not notice the steganographic message that is conveyed by an international visual method of telegraphing words. Each word is one that I imagine being used to describe people in the community, their actions, artists, and/or their work.\n\nEvery output brings me joy, and is a reminder to treat others with kindness and positivity.\n\nWatch as the pixels sort themselves out. \n\nRendering is best viewed in Chrome on a desktop with a high end GPU.\n\nA portion of the proceeds will go toward the international Make-A-Wish Foundation in the hopes of bringing some joy to critically ill children around the globe.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NWz-TBC0xdjk9y6KVnHnWQmSFnBRG3SqxPb7E0p0UpybIy6SaPu7rKXDCixtEEDKoHLi9KHB_B9oiR7R_ZLrgwbo19OUBz1obpE"},

Empiricism describes the world, while rationalism explains it. This conflict has been at the core of me throughout my studies, and I explore the idea further in this project.\n\nDipolar tries to answer the question \"What would electromagnetism look like in two dimensions?\", itself rich in the ideas of rationalism. To an empiricist, it is a question which can not be answered, but the answer has impacts throughout physics, from 3D electromagnetism to condensed matter. These questions and those like them have been grappled with for thousands of years, and we will die without knowing if our attempts at answers will be seen any differently from Plato's theory of Forms.\n\nOur three-dimensional universe constrains by its symmetry the behaviour of point charges to the radial fields that we are used to. In two dimensions the fields can curl around the charge, leading to two kinds of fields able to be produced by a charge. When paired with another particle of the same type and equal but opposite charge they create a 'dipole moment', which look alike when composed of either type of charge. Dipolar shows the field profiles produced by these combinations for each type, and as an idealised 'point dipole'.\n\nThe style was inspired by the sketches of Euler and da Vinci. Both were revolutionary minds, they sought to understand and explain the world in diagram, a tradition that has been preserved in art and science to this day. More broadly, I've felt inspired by Sol Lewitt and Vera Molnar, in particular their use of dense detail, seeing how it can provide tension in their work and draw the viewer in closer.\n\n*An SVG for plotting can be downloaded by pressing DOWN*\n*A 4096x4096 image can be downloaded by pressing UP*\n*Plotting speed can be adjusted with LEFT/RIGHT*\n*The animation can be restarted with SPACE*", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NteiZgET7b7vFP9e77QAcbu3AAD2X5J8GqwvTh7zzWkxYhklSAw_a25iCQ51esedRlpSRRL758d7WjT3Hje7_apB9uYE7lOcrg"},

Over the 25 years of her artistic career, LIA's working process has typically involved as much intuition as it does engineering skill, and this piece is no exception. Growing from an initial Processing sketch by way of the artist's careful selection of angles, transparencies, and line weights, a virtually infinite sequence of house-like forms appears and disappears. LIA conceives of her practise as a conversation between her own fluid concepts and the formal precision required of software code; when accidents or bugs appear, they are often treated as a part of this conversation and incorporated into the final work. In this piece the “cheeky blue” and “cheeky red” features arise from a bug in calculating the colour spread, and have been retained for their aesthetic contribution to the images. Taking inspiration from the song “Little Boxes” by Malvina Reynolds, this piece is a contemplation of houses and cities. The cyclical relationship between the construction of homes, the lands and environments they have replaced, and the ecosystems that will eventually replace them is echoed through an infinite production of geometric compositions. “little boxes on the hillsides, child” is the successor of “little boxes on the hillsides, mother”, presented in the exhibition “Synthetic Imagination” at bitforms gallery San Francisco, October 2–November 15, 2021. The NFTs minted on Art Blocks are the children of the “mother” work: brilliantly colourful, they are rendered in stillness as an artifact of the mother program's generative output, whose ancestry can be activated on the Art Blocks website by pressing the 'a' key to reveal the animated process behind the production of the still image.

The movement that emerged is akin to light fracturing through water, the bark of trees, or the skin of reptiles. When redacted into visible pixels it harkens to traditional screen-printing and a web 1.0 dream. When the patterns start multiplying, they become portals to elsewhere, while also signifying a system trying to ‘learn’ the movements of the earth. I see the ‘hibernal’ as blizzards, ‘maelstrom’ as dreams of the deep water and the ‘arboretum’ as lush gardens. The palette variable is meant to mirror lavish watercolor washes while the smokey ribboning represents the winds. In totality, I hope is to blur many lines – constructed and broken down, calming and fearsome, aspirational and apocalyptic.\n\n\n*The Genesis Edition*\n\nThe first 48 mints shall receive this special edition collection, which includes:\n\n* A unique print of the minter’s piece, printed on archival Hahnemühle German etching paper, mounted on 16” x 12” (40.6 cm x 30.5 cm) maple board, signed and titled on verso.\n\n* A serpentine rock I collected near 34.744145603, -119.98518572 (including a maple presentation stand).\n\n* A limited edition visual compendium chronicling the conceptual theory of the work, signed and numbered.\n\nPlease visit the [project website](https://thespringbegins.io/the-genesis-edition) for more details about the Genesis Edition.\n\nControls:\n\np - for a high resolution (6000 x 7200 pixels) printable version\ns - to save the image as a png file", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oQXIVZkPOFGItPqtpMR_Ec-zL9sRMySG_LNUZOVAC7PT1fW6A8Dr793REFkAfRI5IrgX48iFgdL66b1o1GFhD1UQiIbbtJ9vapg"},

Each output contains a selection of geometric shapes that slide, twist, and resize over time. Their intersections divide the canvas into two regions, each with its own set of rules for generating mathematical textures. As predictable geometry and chaotic automata intersect and evolve, a variety of organic and artificial patterns emerge. Gradually, the colors and rules shift, and new forms appear. Through a series of carefully reflected changes, symmetry persists.\n\nEach animation is constructed from large virtual pixels. By varying their scale, spacing, and alignment a variety of patterns are generated — ranging from a pixel art aesthetic to one with softer, larger-scale structures. Where does a tiny pixel end, and the emergent whole it’s a part of begin?\n\nBuilding on the foundation laid in __*mono no aware*__ and __*Zoologic*__, __*Implications*__ continues the work of making the beautiful complexity of cellular automata visible and accessible. New techniques for optimization, color generation, and constraint selection -- along with simplifications to features and interactive controls -- place focus squarely on an endless and compelling animated experience.\n\n__*Implications*__ is a meditative work best experienced over the course of at least a few minutes. Put on some music, full-screen the live view, and enjoy the show! What sorts of symmetry do you see? What sorts of shapes and textures are there, and how do they move?

What is a sketch when it’s not a conventional drawing? Whether they take the form of code, video, 3D models, immersive spaces, or multimodal explorations that don’t fit a neat categorization, these “sketches” are no less integral to the development of the respective artist’s body of work. Because of the relative novelty among audiences, the technical and conceptual merits of these process-oriented arts can be difficult to grasp, leaving underlying poetics invisible or misinterpreted. Worse still is the assumption that this work is tantamount to button-pushing, that machines are the true authors — trivializing the years spent developing a unique relationship with these materials.” — Jesse Damiani", "imageUrl": "/resources/images/collectionlogo.png"},

On their journey, shapes cross over one another while occasionally encountering loops, beams, and numbered asteroids.\n \nFrom the earliest sketches, questions emerged: Where are they going? Who are they? Will their fall or race ever end? Where is the finish line? Or as Italo Calvino’s character Qfwfq, in the story The Form of Space, while falling, assuming he is falling, occasionally moving in an upward direction, maybe just flowing along an unknown path in the space without above and below, wonders if his trajectory will intersect with his love-longing in the future. On this never-ending fall, passing by one or many universes revolving around them, he contemplates all the positive and negative outcomes, dreaming of their parallels eventually meeting:\n\n“In this alternation of hopes and apprehensions, I continued to fall, constantly peering into the depths of space to see if anything heralded an immediate or future change in our condition. A couple of times I managed to glimpse a universe, but it was far away and seemed very tiny, well off to the right or to the left; I barely had time to make out a certain number of galaxies like shining little dots collected into superimposed masses which revolved with a faint buzz, when everything would vanish as it had appeared, upwards or to one side, so that I began to suspect it had only been a momentary glare in my eyes.\n\n […] unwound in continuous, parallel, straight lines which mean nothing beyond themselves in their constant flow, never meeting, just as we never meet in our constant fall […]”\n\nTo all on unknown latitudes, exploring forms of the space.\n\n-------------\nControls: \n\n[p] key or click/tap for pause/play animation\n\n[a] turn auto rotate on/off\n\n[n] rotate view clockwise\n\n\n-------------\nMade with p5.js and chroma.js. \n\n-------------\nMinting 3 tokens at a time will generate a series of Latitudes in all 3 possible directions in the same color palette. \n\n\n\n\n", "imageUrl": "https://arweave.net/ccG1ZTwT6OA07taSQVzFRZoPTr8XRPJRs68aX4T1NWE"},
