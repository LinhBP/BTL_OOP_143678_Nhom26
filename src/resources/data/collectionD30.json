After a millennia of slumber it must again usher its minions into the expanse. It must sustain. It must replenish. So it guides its horde out to the stars, visiting countless worlds to restart the cycle. For an eternity the cycle has repeated, minding and tending this garden of worlds. Now it is time for the garden to give back. This event has come to be known as *The Harvest*.\n\n*The Harvest* depicts worlds that exist in eternal symbiosis with the Caretaker. We witness the spectacle of monumental chromatic beams as they impact the surface of these beautiful, alien bodies. The Caretaker assigns different constellations to each planet, giving rise to unique combinations of beams as they extract the much needed nectar. This project has been inspired by a life-long fascination for science fiction and space exploration. Aiming to capture a moment of awe, the beams reach to their origin, emulating a cathedral-like atmosphere in the vein of Hugh Ferriss, while borrowing inspiration from Micheal Whelan’s landscapes. All in the effort of capturing a sense of how small we are in relation to the cosmos.\n\n*The Harvest* is built on p5js, and takes advantage of its 3d api. With the orthogonal view enabled, the algorithm uses volumetric rectangular units to create the stylised illusion of alien landscapes. Each beam has a position, color, reach and yield that is calculated and procedurally drawn over time.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/e66607aa87a89005b573e509f8fa1ab0.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

The first lunar calendar, dated to 32,000 BC was discovered, drawn on animal bone in caves. It's believed hunters during the last Ice Age used these portable lunar calendars to anticipate the behavior of different animals like Mammoths. Since then, our Moon has been imprinted across all our ancient and modern cultures, even becoming the system from which our Gregorian calendar evolved from. In the present day, investors in crypto have used the Moon symbolically. \n\nWhat does it mean for all of us in crypto to be so ahead of our time, all while using the same metaphor of the Moon for the various measures of success and individual goals we collectively share in crypto? And how will the future appreciate our ambitions and perseverance within the present moment's growing pains on our way to mass adoption? These are some of the questions that Gazers ask.\n\nOn the surface, Gazers function as a lunar calendar, algorithmically synching closely with Moon phases in the sky, joining the blockchain with one of humanity's longest running lineages in art. Gazers seeks to create a community of collectors celebrating the change of our perceptions that happen over time, our collective goals in crypto, and our love of color theory, astronomy, and generative art. \n\nWhat we are building in blockchain and NFTs will primarily be for the benefit of the future. As such, this artwork was designed to pace itself and speed up its frame rate over time, scaling into anticipated advancements in technology that will steadily allow the artwork to run at faster speeds while at larger scales. Each NFT starts out with the assignment of a date from the past 20 years. These dates correspond to events that happened under particular New Moons that shaped my path as an artist. This is the Origin Moon trait and how Gazers is in part a conceptual self portrait. \n\nStarting from the Origin Moon, each New Moon that arrives will speed up the potential animation of the NFT. For example, an NFT with a 20 year old Origin Moon might run at 20 frames per second, appearing as an animation. But one with an Origin Moon fresh from the sale will run closer to 1 frame per second, appearing more like a slowly evolving painting. Every moment, the frame rate of the artwork speeds up fractionally, indecipherable to our eyes. Stacking these advancements over time creates a generational evolution of experience. There is something undeniably beautiful about everything speeding up within our lifetimes, but the Moon, high above us, continues to carry on at the same meandering rate of 29.53 days in each cycle. Much like these blockchain technologies and NFT markets, this artwork was designed to be collected by the present, but appreciated in a greater sense than we can even imagine by the future. \n\nI created Gazers to be like a living artwork, to be lived with, and to not only have the artwork evolve over time but also the appreciation and experience of viewers. As I coded the work, I imagined it hanging on the wall of collectors, a fixture in their physical space. Collectors might spend a moment admiring their work, walk away for a couple hours, and then come back to be delighted, noticing the most subtle of shifts. Each layer of the work consists of pattern designs. With the passage of time, the thickness of the layered lines pulse and the direction a design moves will advance or rotate, changing our perception of color in the most subtle and optical of ways. Each day at midnight, each layer receives a new set of rules in terms of how to rise or shine over the next 24 hours. The result is color that rises and sets, echoing the change of light in our sky.\n\nMy use of color has consistently been what I've been best known for across my 20 year artistic career. In all my work until now, I've made all the color and design choices as I've painted as a human in the moment. But in Gazers, I designed a complex system around color theory as I understand it, joining my talent for coding with my vision for color. \n\nMany NFT collectors of my work might be familiar with the additional experiences some of their NFTs unlock at my website. Rather than use a Gazers NFT to unlock a website, I decided this time to create rendering modes that unlock within the code over time. These additional modes of viewing are intended to help a collector better understand the architecture of their artwork's design and also benefit from greater enjoyment of it. The addition of these experiences should present an additional benefit to HODLing for some. \n\nEvery 29 and a half days, we reach a Moon phase called the New Moon. This is when the dark side of the Moon is fully visible and no sunlight is reflected from the lunar surface back to Earth. In Gazers, each New Moon phase creates a New Moon design. In this artwork, the hash seed creates color theory and design rules. These rules are deterministic and dictate all the moons that will generatively be created into infinity. Time reveals our moons. Pairing time with deterministic generative code creates the ephemeral moment. We can all agree that looking at the Moon in the sky never seems to be the exact same experience twice, nor the exact same from different locations. I wanted to echo this nature in Gazers and emphasize the urgency and rarity of our present moment and how an artwork can capture this. \n\nAs individuals, we all have our own version of the Moon and what reaching it means. Just as our goals change over time, often subtly, sometimes dramatically, so will our moons, creating a visual representation that might coincide with what's changing inside of us. In crypto, we are all ahead of our time. We are all gazers. And we are all waiting for our next Moon.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pepqUFeetYERaIb1kC9AtXGwvHDQ27ejxY4Y3rrWGh_N9WVepMRe6vBcm-DbMpJxoAfys3Rjb74INOvHl3BQ7f_uXF9_qvqy2A"},

This rhythm turns the visual complexity into an active experience.\n\nASDF: “My work should offer individual ways of interpretation, or even allow one to find some self in it.

Asendorf discovered various interesting details in these works, which eventually became fundamental in his artistic expression.\n\nCargo is a real time WebGL software written in JavaScript and GLSL. At its core is a flip-flop render buffer, also known as feedback buffer. That means the animation is alternately rendered in two different frame buffers. This technique allows the usage of the previous frame of the animation as an asset in the current rendering, which allows for a series of reactive animation strategies.\n\nAn initial image with variable structures and patterns is rendered and subsequently loaded into the frame buffer. A fragment shader is used to apply a set of animation algorithms that make the pixel move and a set of reset algorithms that constantly try to recreate the initial image. The final animation happens in selected containers and is always a combination of two algorithms, one from each set. By regularly animating and partially resetting the pixels, a wide range of movement patterns appear.\n\nCargo is a responsive and pixel exact artwork and it will fill the screen on any display size, thus changing the total amount of used pixels accordingly. This results in the fact that the detail level in the artwork is changing depending on the dimensions. The overall structure is consistently stretching the x and y axis independently. Single containers scale along the dimensions and offer more pixels to render the patterns at a larger representation compared to a smaller representation. This behavior leads to a brilliance, perfect pixels, a crisp rendering with nothing like compression artifacts.\n\nThis software includes the [simplex noise](https://github.com/jwagner/simplex-noise.js) JavaScript implementation by Jonas Wagner and the [cellular noise](https://github.com/stegu/webgl-noise) GLSL code by Stefan Gustavson.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YStoMZzvSrc9jrbZwj3d84GAiyqVTwsJLehjLTC_VP7RTs1Is6euMyF0KN8k-JDuJAxfLLf-95Klwi45sZjHnGTL--jtvQp3Il0"},

Snowfro) has been intrigued by the idea of representing digital artwork in the physical world in the form of an ephemeral physical object with meaning, but with no inherent value. \n\nDonald Judd has long been an inspiration for Art Blocks. One aspect we admire most about Judd’s artistic practice is the elegance of design he effortlessly paired with the accessibility of materials that could be found at a hardware store. With Judd as inspiration, we hatched a plan to create a unique generative art friendship bracelet that includes instructions to make, in minutes, a simple bracelet using a few dollars’ worth of embroidery floss. Donald Judd believed that what surrounds us in our day-to-day life is already so beautiful, and that ultimately the experience of creating art is as important as owning it.\n\nErick was incredibly excited to collaborate with renowned artist Alexis André (a.k.a. MacTuitui) to bring generative art and ephemeral physical objects together in the form of friendship bracelets. Conceptualized by Erick and aesthetically and programmatically designed by Alexis, this project pairs creative coding with a beautiful spectrum of embroidery floss colors. The project was a true team effort, as each member of the Art Blocks team designed and named their own color palette!\n\nThe project is a token of our appreciation to the creators, makers, builders, and collectors who have all contributed to making the Art Blocks community what it is today. Participating in this project is a signal, both online and IRL, that you’re a participant in this evolution of art + community. You are pushing the best ideas forward. You are the reason all of these imaginative projects come to life. Our community is what makes all of this possible. So, to say it plainly, we appreciate you, and we hope that you’ll accept this bracelet as a token of our special friendship!\n\nThe owner of any wallet with an Art Blocks piece at the time of snapshot (October 26, 2022, at 3pm US Central time) is eligible to claim two mints from this special generative art project. We would love to see you keep one bracelet and share your love for generative art by gifting your second mint! These mints are free to claim (you pay only the gas) and exist on L1 Ethereum. Please note that we may in the future release additional modified iterations of the Friendship Bracelets project, ideally on an L2 scaling solution, that may substantially increase the total supply of tokens related to the project, with the intent of being a more accessible entry point to a larger audience. But this version is what we're here to celebrate today, and this gift is for you in gratitude for your support along the way. Please enjoy this token of our friendship and explore the wonderful artwork created by Alexis André. Then, let's all make bracelets together! \n\nWarmly,\nAlexis + Erick + the Art Blocks team\n\n\n\nThe claim window expires on January 10, 2023, at noon US Central time.\n\nClick into the Display Notes for information about making your bracelet.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/P3oEmfNNRGQgkLA1z3ya7NBdjlw_BXuStDPEoEzGiCcqykQlDh5wJgzOet2DE88cv8hNUTgA33DwO54O7mni1No_5alxHqY84-vy"},

Bringing together choreography, code, blockchain, generative art, and cryptography, the work culminates in a live performance. Each output is driven by the motion data of its underlying unique, on-chain choreographic sequence. The sequences behind the first 100 minted works (mint #2 to #101) will be performed during the IRL premiere. The hosting art institution will be announced in 2023. \n\nA journey of slowly recovering the human unfolds as such: 1) reveal on Art Blocks, 2) uncover the choreographic score, and 3) final performance. After the reveal, the human is still unreadable, visible only through the results of movement on glass, obfuscated by code, rendered as a still image. In the next phase of the work, collectors get a glimpse at their underlying choreography by unlocking the secondary token—an on-chain choreographic score. In the final phase, the performance, life is breathed into the human movement that has been lying dormant inside the pieces. **Human Unreadable** brings flesh and viscerality into code and \"vulnerability as a feature\" into long-form generative art. What you don’t immediately see in the visual artwork outputs is the invisible potentiality of performance, inscripted on-chain and able to be brought to life by a dancer at any moment. \n\n **Human Unreadable** intentionally punctures the safety of modernist design and the idea of a universal voice, pushing the limits of human expression within rigid technical systems. With a focus on the body, the collection brings risk, chaos, confusion, and vulnerability to the reveal, everything that function-focused design systems normally prevent. Each piece is an invitation, a transparent layer through which the messy human experience can come into focus through the three phases of the work. This work is a continuation of the pivot away from modernism, clean lines, and the quietly gendered values therein, in favor of a more embodied and sensual approach to human-machine collaboration pioneered by early women in digital art. **Human Unreadable**'s 6 distinct looks derive from the core materiality of Operator’s Privacy Collection: glass, light, x-ray and the human body. The transparent and illuminating nature of these materials reveal what is below the surface.\n\nWhat are you revealing when you reveal?\n\n**Human Unreadable** has roots in various histories such as computational choreography (Analivia Cordeiro, Jeanne Beaman), Merce Cunningham's Chance Dance, and the Experiments in Art and Technology movement. With Ti’s extensive background as an HCI technologist and multimedia artist and Catherine’s background as a choreographer and performance artist, Operator architected a bespoke team, 25+ individuals ranging from specialized engineers to dancers, who embarked on a 9 month process to realize the work. Operator's on-chain generative choreography method is the technical backbone of **Human Unreadable**—the process and open source tooling for which will be made available via white paper in 2023.  \n\n\n***Additional Information***\n\n**First Minter Benefits** \nThe first 100 minted pieces (mint #2 to #101) from the collection will be performed in the IRL premiere in an art institution. \n-Mint #2 to #101 will be counted as the first 100 mints. Mint #0 and #1 are artist mints held by Operator.\n-Hosting art institution will be announced in 2023. \n-Additionally, Privacy Key 00 holders will have one of their collected Human Unreadable sequences performed.\n\n**Choreographic Score (secondary token)** \n-The secondary token will be released at the end of June 2023.\n-The secondary token is a choreographic score that represents the unique choreography that generated the output minted on Art Blocks. For this reason, the Art Blocks token and the secondary token are bound together and cannot be transferred separately.\n-The underlying choreographic score visible through the secondary token can be performed by a choreographer or dancer at the collector's discretion.\n\n**GPU Intensive Rendering / Live Preview** \nThis piece involves GPU intensive composition and rendering of programmatically drawn body parts, generative glass objects, x-ray shaders as well as motion paths. As a result the ‘live preview’ on your laptop or phone may look less detailed than the PNG on Art Blocks which is rendered by a high powered computer. Not to worry!\n\n**Official Token-gated Prints** \nHuman Unreadable collectors will be able to purchase Operator official, signed, token-gated prints (on hand-selected materials) of their collected piece(s).", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WhZdpCPxyUOU5HMBjf3WuLfXTUfqVGriBKuurI_cq_XbPUdp3CmpuBknVhQF1m3JP2ZaG7k6RElRjrLXHLklpKD6x3yyfc-rtA"},

Pictograms and hieroglyphics turned into paintings, which eventually became moving images and photoreal graphics. Spoken words evolved into written text, eventually becoming complex screenplays, computer code, and a world of hyperlinks. Most mediums are not discarded, but combined or extended to incorporate new technology or ideas. \n\nWhen a new medium comes into existence, the capabilities of both the artist and viewer increase. The potential subjects within said medium can grow in complexity as well, some fully dependent on the medium that holds them. Other subjects are timeless, popping in and out of multiple movements and genres throughout history. An example of the latter is still life. From ancient carvings through contemporary art, scenes of commonality, beauty, and metaphor have persisted. Traditionally viewed as a type of technical practice or meditation (the bottom of the “hierarchy of genres”), some examples of still life have gone on to be among the most important works in art history. \n\nChimera is a natural progression of still life. It is an old tradition in the very new medium of on-chain generative art, a movement that will have an enormous presence in the future. Chimera simultaneously reaches into the past while exploiting the capabilities of the present and seeks to represent a unique moment in time, a generation of art in between digital and physical realities, encapsulating where we came from and where we are going. \n\nNOTES:\n\nChimera is graphically intensive. Modern hardware is recommended. Ensure that your browser has hardware acceleration enabled.\n\nThe charitable portion of this release will be donated to various cancer research efforts.\n\nCONTROLS:\n\n“A”: Toggle animations\n“R”: Toggle autorotation\n“C”: Capture screenshot\n“H”: Capture HD screenshot (CPU intensive) \n\n—\n\nThank you to all that participate in, share, or otherwise support this release.

It is inspired by the aesthetics inherent in screen printing along with the compositions and colors of both Bauhaus, Constructivism, and pulp fiction sci-fi covers.\n\nThe compositions in \"Screens\" is based purely on strict geometries and plays with the tension, and symphonies that can be created from combining simple rules. The end result can range from chaotic non-figurative to strongly ordered isometric scenes.\n\nThe generative system underlying the rendering mimics the screen printing process by rendering and applying a single color at a time to a master image. Each virtual screen may be more or less aligned with the master, creating a lovely flawed balance to the precision of the rendered geometry.\n\n25% of the proceeds from this project will be donated to Den Blå Planet, The Danish National Aquarium, in support of their work on preserving and restoring marine life and ecology.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/n2xsI88RBBV8vxkQVvBlfO_4EVey3097-pgK29Oid-Id7aOGZrwE1qvi6eZBjiwrSfYEFTEsjvr_OXwDOkeBc_f_4EhnRFUVKg"},

The work is informed by notions of choreography, modular pattern composition and character design.\n\nKubikino is an idiosyncratic face, made of a combination of graphical elements and colours generated by code. Using an essential library of geometries - all deriving from the circle - and primary tones, the code randomly creates new faces resembling human physiognomy, animals and traditional masks.\n\nThrough the deliberate reference to a face, Kubikino prompts contemplation on the traditional notions of identity, similarity, and persona, as well as the ongoing need to establish one's own representation within a community - from traditional masks to digital avatars. For centuries, human identity has been a source of cultural fascination, with the word \"identity\" stemming from the Latin term \"identitas,\" signifying both \"sameness\" and “oneness.”\n\nInspired by Bruno Munari's \"Faces,\" a collection of abstract portraits created using basic geometric shapes and lines, Kubikino reflects on the simplicity, playfulness, and power of design to communicate across cultures and generations.\n\nDrawing upon the influential dance theories of Rudolf Laban and Merce Cunningham, Kubikino's device process for the creation of its faces is underpinned by a sophisticated framework of modular pattern composition. The project's generated output is organised into a grid-based structure, where each section corresponds to a phrase, and the relationship between the various sections collectively generates the final composition. Referencing Laban’s Movement Analysis, each section is paraphrasing LMA's four key components: body (loop), shape (direction), dynamic (colour), space (relationship within the space).\n\nKubikino also adopts the principles of \"chance\" and \"structured improvisation\" articulated by avant-garde pioneers John Cage and Merce Cunningham in the 1960s. The Kubikino identity is constructed from a selected array of animated graphics, rules, and paradigms that correspond to motifs, scores, and ensembles found in conventional art forms such as dance, music, and paintings.", "imageUrl": "https://media-proxy.artblocks.io/0x99a9b7c1116f9ceeb1652de04d5969cce509b069/464000000.png"},

The main environmental parameter of the composition is the determination of a season of the year. The season determines the landscape’s colors and defines specific phenomena for each of them, such as rain in summer, snow in winter, petals falling in autumn, and pollen in spring. The flower has several possible variables, which can be macro aspects, affecting the entire population of the species, or micro, affecting each individual of the species differently. For example, the number of petals can be equal in all individuals or not. The number of filaments and other structures of the flower can undergo minor deviations, generating small mutations. The confusion between the figure (plant) and the background (earth, sky, other natural elements) is fascinating from a compositional point of view. The background colors are, most of the time, colors present in the figures, often breaking the boundary between them and, therefore, generating chromatic masses. In this project I also intend to research the following question: How to create parameters that resemble a living organism's growth? In this sense, the project approaches digital morphogenesis and the development of procedural organisms.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MzAJlgi8SpY3feDhGTCort9aRlbPCd27NPi-2-jUTGMY_I_1dGLr8jufCk79QEkm0_er8mMpg2M6kBm38ya-hXx6UhBqH92QhGM"},

No compression, no Netscape, no social media, no NFTs. The JPEG compression has specifically enabled photography-based imagery on the net. It has always served that purpose and over time become the de facto default for showing high quality imagery online. But compression always leaves a trace, which has become the lens through which the network sees the world of uploaded images.\n\n\"A painting is not a picture of an experience, but is the experience.\" ― Mark Rothko\n\nJPEG tries to create an image programatically fully expressing that signature compression. An image that is like empty made from barely nothing, yet fully present in its blazing appearance. A work deeply material, expressing itself through the language of code and codec only. This is not a JPEG depicting an image. The JPEG is the image itself.\n\nDelving into the depths and peculiarities of the digital, tethered to art history, JPEG found its way to the surface. Generated color fields are utilised to trigger the compressing algorithm, resulting in a world of raw visual entities. Where the abstract expressionists cut out the depiction in painting, aiming to let the artist convey pure emotion, JPEG cuts out the artist's emotion and lets it emerge from within the algorithm. Carefully you could categorize the work as *compressionism*. An art form where the machine speaks in its own raw language, but nevertheless makes a direct touch to our human heart.\n\nJPEG is a collection of generative images in the JPEG file format. The work tries to break with the idea of the fixed file format, therefor creating the JPEG entirely from code using no image material whatsoever. The individual JPEGs are generated responsively at the moment of viewing based on the token hash as a random seed. You can literally drag the JPEG out from the browser window.\n\nJPEG pays tribute to interface culture, and as such the work is responsive and not scaling. When the work is resized, the work is again rendered and compressed. When viewed smaller, details will disappear, yet the composition stays recognisable. It’s like stepping back to see a work from further away. The choice of color wanders from monochromatic tones to the brutality of complete randomness and everything in between.\n\nIn honour of the blockchain and the web, the work is written in vanilla JavaScript, using no dependancies, and generates a standard JPEG. This way the file is downloadable, aiming for a materiality that comes as close as possible to the standard browser.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kFuNX4IUaGGwtl4ldvxLk0XY0NptN3FIFMriOvcfbHEJA44j9njtjJcvWqqAWEW9HloNWgZQNMt2Wvb-RANMD_cCpjYHH4AAWuw"},

Yet we fail to fully comprehend this in our daily errands. Entretiempos is an artwork that reflects on this, based on an aesthetic that pays a tribute to the works of Sonia Delaunay, František Kupka and other painters from their era, recreated by the usage of intersecting rings that create a varied and rich space.\n\nThe work plays with the time scales by painting dynamically and letting the viewer pause the work, restart, set it to loop indefinitely, painting and vanishing in an endless cycle. And it can be set to be done at varying speeds, to appreciate what happens in between the time scales (\"entre tiempos\", in Spanish).\n\nAlso, there is a broader theme that I find of interest to explore from every work that I engage with. It has to do with the concept of what I call total cognitive space, or the total range of possibilities that can be expressed / achieved with a given scenario and set of conditions. In this case, I was interested in expanding my rendition of the works of Delaunay into a broader space. How does this approach scale with varying parameter ranges? Is the painting still interesting? Can it express something new? Connected to this, I am also interested in thinking about what emotions would mean for an artificial sentient being. We talk about artificial intelligence, but leave aside artificial emotions all too often. While artificial intelligences are indeed interesting, we fail to recognize the paramount importance of emotions in human behaviour. To this end, this work explores also the result of painting with machine-like precision vs. performing the artwork with a range of possible imprecisions. The perfection of the machine vs. the imperfection of the human, does it trigger different emotions in us humans? What will the reaction of a machine be whenever they develop a taste?\n\nThis work exposes features that deal with its time and space scales, background colour, background elements, the palettes used, certain colour accents that may happen (golden accents, b&w tones), the style used to draw the geometric shapes (fill, lines, outline), the degree of paint precision and other features that influence the final result. The user may download a PNG file at any arbitrary resolution at any step of the paint process using the commands provided for that. A brief list of commands is as follows. Please note that you need to click on the artwork first to make sure it will receive the typed commands:\n\np to pause/resume the work\nr followed by y to enter the looping mode\nd followed by +/- or any number from 1 to 9 to increase resolution\ns followed by c to save current image\ns+f to automatically save the final image when the system finishes painting\ns+m to restart and save a sequence of images of the process\nr+0 (zero) to reset all parameters and resolutions and restart\nk at any time to define keyframes, then r+0 to restart the work and it will automatically pause at defined steps, or s+i and the work will restart and automatically save an image at every keyframe defined with k. Reload browser to reset.\n\nThere is an Easter egg hidden in every work.\n\nFor the full project description, inspiration and rationale, as well as the full list of features and controls plus a hint at the Easter Egg, please visit the project homepage at https://www.iillucid.com/entretiempos", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_7oB6tc8f3h0CuIoC1NihQSASyHwTdGyuRdB6oquKh8kUVIzSJ3LsPOD-h8-APin2pBaInSzlbvfCucw95TvH1zcjfpywNIaSLU"},

I saved my favorite picture files and small free software files to floppy disks with a capacity of roughly 1 megabyte and stored them carefully. Those floppy disks were my treasure. Later, when the disks deteriorated and became unreadable or were lost, the data became memories with a deep feeling of loss.\n\nBlockchains have arisen. Are these truly persistent?\n\nAfter all, digital data are also a type of memories. They are stored in a person's mind, deteriorate, and one day will be lost with that person.\n\nI find the fragility and beauty in them.\n　\n\n\n\n\n\n　\nIn this work, I attempted to represent a fictional collapsed blockchain world with visuals and sound.\n　\nThe chain has already been abandoned, and the few nodes that remain barely alive are just maintaining their appearances. Visualizing the remnants of blocks that no longer serve their original purpose, they form something like a submerged city. Then, a large amount of data that has lost its connection to the blocks and has deteriorated to the point that it can no longer be opened, flutters through the sky. The countless remnants of data form a cloud, which undulates like a wave. The details of the data cannot be confirmed, however, they can be seen as glittering lights. As I try to recall the contents of the data that can no longer be opened, I am filled with vague memories and a sense of nostalgia.\n\nThis work started with generating sound by code. The sound of rippling waves can be heard by clicking on the screen. Since it would be impractical to store huge sound data on the blockchain, the sound was formed from white noise. In order to reproduce the sound of rippling waves, it was necessary to deepen my understanding of the structure of the sound by referring to academic papers. Then the sound was completed, and the visual imagination expanded from there.\n\nI like to visit the sea near my home and in other places. Different seascapes can be seen from different locations and angles. When I am there, idly gazing at the seascape and listening to the sound of the waves, I sometimes feel as if I am the only human there and the world has gone to ruin. If the world were ruined, this seascape and the sound of the waves would remain for a long time. This feeling and the fragility felt in digital data are the basis of this work. I imagine that the heaven or the graveyard where the lost data flies up in the sky and arrives may be a seascape like this.\n\nThe reason why I used data as lights and clouds drifting in the sky and moved them like waves is because I wanted to depict unrealistic behavior with a realistic subject matter and to express a beautiful and bizarre world in which these intertwine.\n\nFor the visual expression technique, I further pursued and evolved the drawing system that I have developed in \"GHOST IN THE CODE\" and my other works. Everything is composed of rectangles, indicating that this world is beginning to become low-resolution. Depth is linked to the size of the rectangles, and distant objects are represented by small rectangles as if they were in focus. Dispersion in the position and color of the rectangles indicate the degree of deterioration of the world. Moreover, the sky, blocks, and the surface of the water are identified and each has its own characteristics.\n\nAlgorithms generate various compositions, colors, and other features. I have attempted to make each output feel nostalgic and fresh at the same time. The blocks, which have lost their original meaning, are contrasted with the data, which exists in isolation from them, in stillness and movement. Occasional red clouds or blocks mean that they are corrected as red, the first color, due to missing information.\n\nThrough these integrations, I have attempted to create a work that can be stored on a blockchain, and that is both visually and sonically interactive.\n\n[NOTE]\n\n-To save the image press the 'S' key.\n-To change the flow velocity press the '↑' or '↓' key.\n\nModern hardware and browser hardware acceleration is recommended.

The visual language is reminiscent of hand-draughted technical drawing, a precise and methodical practice that progresses at a radically different pace to the flowing and capricious movement of water. To increase this tension between dynamic motion and static mechanical process I wanted the surface textures to appear worn and aged like a drawing that has spent its life in the bottom of a mechanics drawer. This process of abrasion and discoloration is occurring on yet another scale of time adding complexity to the references of time passing. \n\nWoven into the very fabric of Fontana is a fully generative solution for creating color expression. This means there is no reliance on preset palettes with every output being an entirely unique color articulation of the color story I want the project to reveal as a whole. Far from being random I attempted to create an approach which produces colors that evoke early 20th Century art and design media. With this intention I wanted  outputs to look like they could be working drawing artifacts from this period of time.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IAw49JE1J0qIwu3kET1SXQVPrJxrWNArLNhidtcZlMTvHg-b3rhMX7fSmUR13Gu-WPXQV92IW0HhYDD2OjrXL_seASX-FLycBg"},

Accept that intuition often falls short in predicting the best way forward (*especially* when creating generative art), and entertain any idea that presents itself.\n\nStaying mostly within the confines set by these rules, the development of Gumbo ended up taking me on many unexpected journeys.\n\nAt its core, Gumbo explores the diversity of form that can be achieved by combining simple shapes, such as spheres, donuts, boxes, and cylinders. Despite the basic components, the final arrangements are strangely familiar, some reminiscent of space stations, others of internal organs. By painting these structural canvases in an indiscriminate fashion, an intricate interplay between colour and form arises, emphasizing the spatial nature that underlies both. Texture, a subject I deeply appreciate, stars as the main character of Gumbo, celebrated both as a reference to the material world, and, especially, as something with uniquely digital characteristics. Present throughout the project, it is primarily used to illuminate the structures and add life to otherwise flat blocks of colour.\n\nWhile working on Gumbo, I've found inspiration from a diverse set of sources, ranging from the vibrant and captivating colours of Cold War-era propaganda posters and Japanese ukiyo-e to the texture-heavy work of artists like Virgil Finlay and Bruce Conner. In addition, Gumbo utilises a rendering approach that can be described as a digital equivalent of physical methods like silkscreen and woodblock printing, a connection that was not recognised until the project's later stages.\n\n**Note**: Gumbo requires WebGL2 and is computationally expensive to render. Older devices will probably struggle!\nTo save a high-resolution render, press \"p\" while in live mode and enter the desired size (or add \"?resolution=your-size-here\" to the end of the URL).

At times they appear as strange beings; alive. To make sense of this phenomenon, we are forced to reconsider our notion of the living state beyond what we are familiar with on Earth. \n\nCalian is an infinitely zoomable and scrollable exploration of lifelike behaviour. It exhibits ambiguous natural-digital forms in a dynamic rendering. Species grow and compete; they get carried by the elements; they face boom, bust, and echo. \n\nWhat makes something alive? To go beyond recognition of terrestrial biology we need to delineate general principles and apply them to new intelligent systems. Calian uses the fruits of my research into the origin of life to create persistent, complex systems that we can experience and study (*). We can identify properties of living matter but these fall short of a satisfactory and succinct criterion. When does agency begin? Or identity? Calian asks you to ponder this as you wander through its ecosystems. \n\nFeel free to explore but be careful: although life is pervasive, living things are delicate. Your interactions affect the ecosystem, obliquely. \n\nCalian continues a thread of my work probing deep scientific questions with artistic means.

A systems based approach to creation leaves space for things to emerge that the artist had not conceived. In its best form, it also enables the creation of artwork with complete unity of concept, system, and manifestation as they become one and the same./n/nIn Seating Arrangements, Shannon highlights both the matrix and its product, the print. The algorithm generates a digital file that serves as the blueprint. These unique instructions are then executed by a CNC machine to carve out the distinct sections of the chair. The carved wooden slab is inked, simulta- neously creating the print and painting the final chair. Finally these pieces are assembled to create a free standing chair entirely from the matrix—without any hardware. The print becomes a record of an inter- mediate event and the matrix is shared as the final assembled sculptural piece of furniture./n/nIn this series, the generative algorithm does more than ornament the final structure: it is central to the very essence of the chair. The artist defined 220 short, straight segments of wood that can be included or excluded by the algorithm and can intersect with up to 13 other segments. The repeating geometry of the design allows the viewer to see the positive form of the chair in the included segments and the nega- tive form of the chair in the absence of those that are not./n/nThe range of possibilities for this algorithm is 2^220, or 1,684,996,666,696,914,987,166,688,442,938- 726,917,102,321,526,408,785,780,068,975,640,576 unique chairs. The incomprehensible multitude of potential chairs elevates one of Shannon’s core questions in the work: what is a chair? Many of the potential outcomes are not sittable, but does that exclude it from being a chair if it still registers as one visually?/n/nIf you were to overlap all of the chairs, there would be no single element that is shared by all. The viewer is denied an understanding of the platonic form of a chair, as there is no one common feature that can be distilled as the essence of chair within this series./n/nThe removed segments insert a new dimension to the relationship between body, consciousness, and object. So much of what we come into contact with on a daily basis is designed to recede in our minds— consider “pain free” UI/UX or an office chair. We constantly interact with engineered systems that do not assert themselves. Their recession can mean forgetting that they exist at all, and forgetting that they are designed for their own purposes outside of our wants and needs./n/nThe unique generative structures and simple materiality of Seating Arrangements mean these chairs do not disappear, but rather insert themselves into your consciousness. You must think of how to sit down, perhaps where to put your arm. This awareness of your body and your relationship to the piece reminds you that it has its own identity.", "imageUrl": "https://meta.tonic.xyz/logo.jpg"},

The price you purchase is the price you will pay.*\n\nAn ideal human being is one big optimization problem. We have a goal - we optimize our actions to maximize the outcome of this goal. \nIn our initial days, we optimize to stay alive, during school, we optimize to study well, gain skills and obtain the best scores.\n\nAs we progress in our careers we optimize to get the most amount of money, material growth, and maybe even influential growth such as fame.\n\nAs we age we optimize to minimize diseases and maximize our lifespan - we workout, we eat healthily, we retire, and rest \n\nAs ideal as it sounds, how do we know what exact actions would lead to maximizing my outcome? At this very moment - instead of reading this should you be doing something else that would make your life’s outcome better? Maybe, maybe not - We don't know... Although, we do find out through trial and error. \n\nIn the grand scheme of things we’re just an agent exploring actions around us, learning which ones increase our reward and choosing the path that seems to lead to the maximum reward. Cerebellum is a window (pun intended) of the human mind - a continuously evolving art piece that is built on top of a reinforcement learning agent that is learning and optimizing and evolving as you see it. \n\nThe project starts with an untrained model of a reinforcement learning agent that is deployed in an environment where it is faced with positive reward and negative reward. The agent is also equipped with a bunch of eyes that lets it sense the objects around it and judge if it wants to go ahead and consume the object or abstain and move in a different direction. The agent here is optimization to maximize its positive rewards while avoiding the negative ones. How does the agent know if a reward is positive or negative? - It learns that after experiencing a bunch of samples. And the magic is - all of this happens in your browser. The seemingly random motion of the agent at the beginning running into everything it sees subsides with time as it learns better about the environment and only hits on the positive rewards. How fast does this happen? Depends on your luck - every art has agents with varied number of eyes and range of these eyes. In addition with every refresh your agent would start from a new place, taking a new path - a path that might lead to it learning things at a different pace depending on what it comes across as it explores. To add some practicality - the environment also has some walls, elements that just block the agent from moving doesn’t add or decrease rewards. Hinders the agent’s movement, lets it find a different path - sometimes this is needed for the agent to strategize, sometimes it's just a hindrance… I’ll leave this to your imagination as you see the agent in action…\nThe seemingly random motion - the path towards true understanding - the process of optimisation is captured by the windows. Windows that show the beauty of this process expressed in a variety of ways. \n\nCerebellum is a window into the black box of AI, an unapologetic exaltation of the unpolished, an ode to the process and its aesthetic vernacular.\n\n+ Press 'p' to switch from 2d/3d views\n+ Press 'e' to expose the reinforced learning layer\n+ Press 't' to pause/unpause the training of the agent\n+ Press 'w' to randomize the walls of the training environment\n\nOn mobile, tap to switch from 2d to 3d", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IXOaZrtzimk2zWsnhlbT68gNX4rSHi-at2QEXKeLrqg7BAyRDcy-9gORGm24vIS9FnKbUJ-mFYsTYo4Qyu-sOfuByv7IJzFWUGc"},

Therefore it comes as no surprise that the programming language of Ethereum is named 'Solidity'. The blockchain is software, yet it behaves and feels like hardware.\n\n🪨\n\nWindow pays tribute to interface culture, and as such, the work is responsive and not scaling. When the work is viewed on a smaller scale, details will disappear, yet the composition stays recognisable. It is like stepping back to see a work from a distance. The work can also increasingly reveal more details when made larger. As a result Window will keep unfolding in the future as resolutions will grow.\n\nThe work follows standard window interactions. Double clicking or tapping the title bar will toggle between full browser and windowed view. On a laptop or desktop in windowed view, you can drag and resize your Window as you please. When made tiny, it makes for a nice profile pic. Clicking or tapping the background will cycle through three different background colours.\n\nWindow comes in seven latent colours and both in Windows Classic or Mac Classic style.\nWith the feature ‘Latent colour’ I look at the invisible steps within the procedure of a generative artwork. I love the idea that the script has chosen to feature a colour, but in a later step could fail to make it to the composition. By showing the colour as a feature, I try to extend the visual work with deeper invisible layers of the generative process.\nCheck the features to see what colour is seeded.\n\nIn honour of the blockchain and the web, the work is written in vanilla JavaScript, using no dependancies, and generates standard HTML DOM aiming for a closer feel of the user interface.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0a6VBhbGo1PRaYJ8AKknjRguEGqVyIeBQrkOufuPacGbxC28_YoswF4KKPXVcuEozkWKObuH-kx9QAQpoDyHHlJFWd9XHxZCazg"},

The loose interpretation of origami dynamics quickly dissolves as physical rules are bent and reimagined.\n\nAn artifact of this process is the distinctive fold lines, which symbolize the Yoshizawa-Randlett diagrams that serve as instructions for Origami. The practice of Kirigami (folding and cutting paper) is also represented and is occasionally visible as highly destructured forms.\n\nContrasting the precision of the folding engine is a spray paint simulation that gives the image its color. Paint is applied with a wandering nozzle, sometimes overflowing past boundaries and dripping downwards. Inspired by the freeform nature of graffiti, the spray paint layers are chaotic and unrefined.\n\nNote: The spray paint simulation may take many seconds to fully render.\n\nAfter the render is complete, press any key to destroy the artwork.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OJvCET0l-5bPdZcjLFPd7xlW9fO__kO_YKy0bozQt1K_zONqy8E3kaXz93Y3xwpVgyFg-gKORIAiiYE-TzAl2JBkR_VRIyLJpA"},

The idea is simple. You start with a string of nodes connected to one another to form a shape. Each node feels 3 forces:\n - A repulsion force from all other nodes\n - An attraction force towards its immediate neighbors\n - An attraction force towards the midpoint between its neighbors\n\nAs you add more nodes into the shape, these 3 rules cause the shape to curve into itself, growing into a complex form of layered undulating lines. The goal is to create a shape that fills as much space as possible while maintaining a rigid form and avoiding overlapping itself. By focusing specifically on where and when you add more nodes, and how you interpret those nodes into a shape, there is much variety to be found in this simple algorithm.\n\nSince I first learned about this technique, and wrote my own version based off these rules, I have been continuing to iterate, evolve, and optimize my code. It's an algorithm I always find myself coming back to, and has become my most researched topic and longest running experiment. I love its use of real life physics, and I find its outputs aesthetically pleasing on a deeper, almost instinctual level. \n\nEach output of 'Spaghetti Bones' starts with a simple shape as a seed for the differential growth algorithm. Throughout the rendering process, the shape is fed more nodes, and grows until it cannot find any empty space to fill. As it grows, a form is interpreted from the nodes of the growth and drawn onto the screen, creating a snapshot of the growth at that particular moment. There are many rules that govern how the shape grows, and how its form is interpreted, and these rules often evolve throughout the rendering process. When the render is complete, the resulting image is a full catalog of the history of the shape's life. \n\nThe name of this project was created by Nicole, my girlfriend and an art wizard. Early on in the development of this project, I asked her to name an output I was sharing, and she chose to call it ‘Spaghetti Bones’ because that’s what it looked like. Since then, the name has stuck with me. I decided to keep the name for the final project in order to highlight the playfulness of each output, to encourage imagination when viewing this abstract art, and to thank Nicole for being tremendously supportive and helpful throughout my exploration of the art world.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VPGV-LNUhYXZZmCDlXnVHcpAT4LqvBRM8nnYzMeiWIl89WY7s6kaVOfQ2Yx5RvLXKMCLLgEOgMAviWLOjG49BVGR_E-BCxVepchE"},

The latent spaces (the algorithmic structures that make AI image synthesis possible) can be seen as a part of our human collective unconsciousness; a hyper dimensional field of unlimited outcomes, inspired by our human symbols and language.\n\nExploring this new type of space, it sparked the idea of exploring the algorithmic essence of my own artworks. What would the structure behind my creative processes look like? What if I could visualize the algorithmic structures of my own mind that produced my artworks in the past?\n\nThese questions led me to The Field, a multidimensional machine hiding in my subconscious.\n\n# THE GENERATOR\nThe first step to reach The Field, was to capture the algorithmic structure behind all my artworks. By compressing several hundred artworks from HyperHash, EnergySculpture, UltraWave & HashCrash into a 64X64 matrix, a noise image has been created. This was done by adding up all these works together.\n\nThis noise image I call The Generator was the starting point to explore possibilities for the creation of a new work. This 64x64 matrix filled with noise data was embedded in the source of the piece and functions as the core of The Field algorithm.\n\n# THE FIELD\nThe Generator is being transformed into a multidimensional field of colors and motion, called The Field. The motions of the field relate to natural processes of creation and destruction. The field is like a fluid, solid and gas-like structure at the same time. It goes from a noisy formless state to a solid material state and back.\n\nThe field is created in a few steps. First a 2d noise pattern is being created from The Generator. This 2d pattern is made by picking random points from the 64x64 matrix. This is the fundamental background of the Field.\n\nThe second step is to use this pattern to set the field in motion. By using the color data per pixel, movement is being initiated. The colors are in that sense multifunctional, on one hand it visualizes random colors extracted from The Generator on the other hand the colors are used to set the field in motion and showing the interrelationship between the colors in an extra dimension: time. This creates the 3D effects, but also creates the effect of lighting bouncing in the field.\n\n\n# REGRESSION, DESTRUCTION & CREATION\nThe creation of the field felt for me like a form of regression. Reviewing the concepts of my previous work, thinking about what overlapped in terms of topics conceptually and design wise drew me back in time.\n\nThe main topic of this work represents is the cyclical nature of creation and destruction. By revisiting my old works and literally destroying them, this new work was created. In this way the work reflects on the causal relation between creation and destruction (what's created will someday be destroyed, something has to be created to be destroyed). A  universal essence of our causal reality behind all that is, a balance between forces, from light to dark, from warm to cold, from dry to wet, from finite to infinite.\n\nThis theme of creation and destruction is visible quite literally in The Field. Every mint of The field has a unique position in the field with color filtering added on top. The locations in the field are composed of  either creational vortices (expanding spirals) and destructional vortices(contracting spirals), a combination of the two in a balanced state (order) or a combination of the two in an unbalanced state (chaos). \n\nThe positions and coloring are a combination of hand-picked settings by me and totally random settings generated by the hash input from the token.\n\n\n# Extra\n- By pressing the buttons a,s,w,d you can move through the field.\n- By pressing L you can activate LavaMode.\n- By scrolling you can zoom in and out.\n\n**** BEST VIEWED IN FULLSCREEN LIVE MODE ON DECENT GPU. ****", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1-871hf5S_WupmhNgn8jR8fUE2GJXiuInjWGe4aGdWJC4S7IK4wa8G7_FGHIuUaOLGLn7SZezppa9TQjo0g4vFK2Y3Kr8AdNGMM"},

The title derives from Mazinaabikinigan-zaaga'igan, an Algonquin word meaning “picture” or “writing”, alluding to the dual nature of pictographs. \n\nInspired by my encounters with neolithic cave paintings in Europe and indigenous pictographs flanking Canadian lakes, Mazinaw hints at etchings, drawings, and anthropomorphic forms. While Mazinaw draws on expressionists from Wassily Kandinsky to Norman Lewis, it takes abstraction one step further: each piece is constructed by the artist indirectly, via a generative code, allowing the emergence of new undreamt-of forms.\n\nThe 19 palettes are inspired by the natural world, but their roles are sometimes twisted: cerulean blue strokes appear over an ochre canvas, and green flashes of light hop across a gray expanse. I invite the viewer to spend time with each piece, finding their own order from chaos. Signed fine-art archival inkjet prints will be available for owners at a modest cost.\n\nNote: Mazinaw is best viewed in large format (full screen), or printed. Each piece has infinitely fine details, some of which will only be visible in print.

Each flag is sited in a fictitious future desert generated uniquely using code-based frequencies, shapes, colours, and skies. These data worlds are spatial and solar—viewers can look around the scene by dragging in its window. Dawn breaks and night falls accurately for the locale that each flag represents across day and year.\n\nWorld Flag imagines a shared but bleak and deeply inequitable future in which ongoing governmental and legislative failures alongside environmental degradation and mismanagement have rendered the state as a ghost, as an apparition of itself. The national flag is reimagined as a performed militaristic sign for a doomed place-based political order.\n\nAll 195 World Flags in the series are generated from one 112 KB script stored on-chain. This script uses the WebGL (web graphics language) protocol, a new medium which allows complex visual data worlds to be rendered directly in the web browser. When distributed using the blockchain mechanism and viewed on mobile electronic devices, the work and medium propose a global public art experience—post place, post geography. \n\nThese are spatial worlds - drag on the scene to look around. Press F on a keyboard for full screen, R to slowly rotate the camera. M to hide the mouse pointer. On a phone or touch screen tip the top of world to go full screen. Tip bottom of world to rotate camera.  Tip top again to leave full screen. Tip bottom again to leave rotation. \n\nFurther Notes\nThe ClimateWatch 2019 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions index for the 195 member countries of the UN is a key conceptual underpinning of World Flag. The artworks from the project will be released in a predetermined order based on the 195 countries’ respective GHG emissions, from highest to lowest, irrespective of population size.\n\nGerrard will also produce a single Artist Proof (A/P) World Flag NFT—a composite of all 195 countries represented in the project that will be reserved for institutional acquisition, and it will be minted upon donation.\n\nJohn Gerrard will dedicate 10 percent of artist’s proceeds from World Flag sales to Hometree, a nonprofit organization that works to address Ireland’s declining biodiversity and the global climate crisis. Through its Wild Atlantic Rainforest Project, Hometree is restoring a temperate rainforest in Ireland, a unique ecosystem.\n\nIn 2021, Gerrard became the first artist within Pace Gallery's program to release an NFT with Western Flag (NFT), an artwork derived from his simulation Western Flag (Spindletop, Texas) 2017, which was commissioned for Earth Day 2017 by Channel 4 in the UK. Western Flag (NFT) recently became the first NFT to be acquired by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\n\nGerrard’s Petro National generative NFT series, released in 2022, was the first Web3 project to be produced as part of the multifaceted collaboration between Art Blocks and Pace Verso. In 2023, Petro National #16 (Nigeria) was acquired by the Centre Pompidou in Paris.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hxzm7idUwR5D3ozOcEOAz1fLvrKtqKW2DcLDMuM0xiPPE6j8afn6DCeeGi7sAE81Mt2k9Tgq6X_pUOmE-DYQBS-kI0mBW1w53rXD"},

Today, using a plotter to create images from code is one decision among many others. Making plotter drawings is difficult and wonderful, and the artists in –GRAPH are passionate about this medium. They share a love of working with visual systems and writing code, and transforming how the code is rendered through drawing machines.

Because it travels at the speed-of-light, time and space as we understand it do not exist for this elementary particle. The Big Bang was less than an instant ago for the photon and yet it has already traversed the cosmos. Time and space to it is what? It's hard to say. The word non-dual comes to mind.\n\nSome components in Photon’s Dream look like images from an electron microscope. Other parts have a more cosmic or planetary vista. Juxtaposing both creates tension and intrigue where the boundary between fine texture and grand architecture becomes blurred.\n\nThe expression ‘One in all: all in one’ is somehow embodied in the wavefield primitives used to make this art. Art that aspires to create both holistic simplicity and the mystery of deep complexity. The quasicrystal and hyperbolic geometry employed here are subjects to the artist that express what is beyond macro and micro, internal and external and ultimately self and other.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4QkdepT_Z2J266zE0K3w-zmz99xn9nIri2WQgxmdfibLWvrh0_hpzfIp_ZyMXwGAJR_ET1OJWAFpqq6cKx79Q5tvlqtxwriM7c"},

Understanding yourself and the unlimited variables and actors surrounding us daily requires a radical yet utopian pursuit of objectivity.\n\nA prerequisite to an objective observation is identifying and eliminating cognitive and observational biases.\n\nMy obsession with objectivity started as a sociology student; while studying epistemology of science and pondering the works of Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Karl Popper.\n\nThis quest never left me and has been a cornerstone of my artistic practice for 25 years.\n\n“The map is not the territory” is a mainstream expression highlighting a potentially oversimplified version of reality. In this series called Neural Sediments, inspired by the works of Alberto Burri, František Kupka, and Swiss topography, I highlight the complexity of our brains and some of their biases.\n\nLooking at one Neural Sediment will deliver you a first broad impression; however, looking at it for a longer time will yield a never-ending and much more nuanced and delicate observation. Like Alberto Burri’s Cracks series, some things not obvious to the eye become real over time. Each Neural Sediment opens itself to the viewer in a unique way. The more you look at it, the more you can decipher it. \n\nLike Swiss alpine glacier sediments, this material appears only after a certain amount of time and a decent amount of gravity. Burri used a special technique to envision time with cracked canvas; František Kupka, in his Katedrála painting, opens the fourth dimension by looking at the vertical lines of the glass window.\n\nIn the Neural Sediments series, I used both as an inspiration to push the viewer’s eye to search for more details and a deeper perspective.\n\nChoosing color palettes for a long-form generative art collection is as demanding as solving technical algorithmic challenges. \n\nThe color palettes I create result from a process I've built into my practice over time. Each palette comes from my own algorithmic selection trained on classical masterpieces.\n\nAfter this first selection, each set of colors used in a Neural Sediment is re-arranged to be linked with endangered ecosystems such as dark blue waters, peach salmons, rare botanic species, or volcanos.\n\nLike Josef Albers, who highlighted the instability and deceptiveness of colors, my color sets are here to reinforce the question of objectivity in the art world and life in general.\n\nLooking at its overall structure, each Neural Sediment evokes a brutalist architecture. \n\nPrioritizing function over form, each Neural Sediment aims to be used as a tool to rediscover oneself, free from the cognitive constraints we put on ourselves and the world around us.\n\nPS: From a technical point of view, Neural Sediments require some heavy calculations, considering the very large number of intersections to compute prior to rendering.\n\nPPS: Pressing the letter “i” on your keyboard will generate a high resolution export for a large scale and print friendly format.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/793c723785d65aed7918c9c98ab2372e.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

Each year, trees add a new ring to their trunks, recording their growth and responding to the changing seasons and environmental conditions. These rings tell a story of the tree's life. By replicating these patterns, the project captures the rhythmic and organic qualities of nature.\n\nIn this project, I wanted to explore the aesthetic and conceptual possibilities of tree rings through code-based art. I used a generative algorithm to simulate the growth of virtual trees, generating patterns that resemble the annual rings of real trees, but with a twist. Instead of using traditional circular or oval shapes, I experimented with different geometric forms and noise. I also played with colors and instead of using earthy and realistic colours, the palettes are inspired by the richness and diversity of the natural world.\n\nThe algorithm works by starting with the outer most ring, which over time grows towards an arbitrary chose center according to certain rules and parameters.

Background information for your enjoyment:\n\nIn 2010, Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Sato posted several photos of her rescue-adopted Shiba Inu, Kabosu, to her blog. Among the photos was a peculiar shot of Kabosu gazing sideways at the camera, which quickly became an iconic meme.\n\nA decade later, Ms. Sato minted the original image as an NFT on Ethereum, which was purchased in auction by [PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO). Following the auction, Pleasr launched and auctioned a derivative token, $DOG, representing a piece of the NFT.\n\nEvery pixel in this collection was minted on the Doge Pixel Portal by locking up 55,240 $DOG (per pixel).

Whether encapsulated in physical or computational techniques, these processes act with their own degree of autonomy from our own biases and as a result, open up new ideas and sensibilities while dismantling traditional notions of authorship. They allow one to code the possibility of discovery and surprise into the creative process in a manner that can be widely shared and because of this transmissibility, algorithms frustrate the idea of a single author, inviting speculation on the shared nature of creativity. For this reason we have always understood our work to be a collaboration between each other, those who share with us and those who inspire us. \n\nOver the years, the studio has indulged in a number of obsessions. One is the conviction that history is a generative source with which to constantly entangle. Whether it is through stories, characters, techniques, or events, history acts as a medium active with properties that constantly reshape and transform our concept of the present. We look back to move forward, like hitching a ride. It is here that we encounter Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528) and his masterpiece Melancholia I (1514) to inspire a deep dive into the process of engraving as a representational technique reinterpreted through the contemporary medium of code. By scratching metal away from a plate, an inversion of conventional drawing, engraving allowed a work of art to be reproduced and disseminated widely. In addition to the piece’s masterful delineation, its allegory resonates with us as well. In Dürer’s time melancholy was associated with insanity but also with creativity. In the engraving, the winged personification of melancholy -- the work is widely regarded to be a self-portrait of the artist -- is surrounded by the tools and elements of geometry. For Dürer, as for a handful of others who came before and after, who test the porous borders between art, science and religion, geometry is a vehicle for imagination, a shadow of the divine and a portal to the infinite. \n\nThis work Primitives is a kindred meditation on infinity through an exploration of a novel geometric structure using algorithm and code, the tools of today's geometers and mystics, made visible through the anachronism of the engravers trade translated into pure 1’s and 0’s. Primitives grows through a single shape that can repeat and scale in specific ways that are never random, but rather tightly governed by geometric logics. It is about drawing infinity through a radical modularity; ordered but aperiodic. Unlike a regular crystal, whose molecular pattern is periodic (or repetitive in all directions), the distinctive quality of this quasicrystal is that its structural pattern never repeats the same way twice. Endless and uneven in aggregate, Primitive clusters can be described by the precise arrangement of a single modular part. As these small units aggregate together they form larger figures that themselves combine into ever larger movements, always a little bit different from any other. In this sense, quasicrystalline patterns have an infinite capacity to create and carry information. \n\nWe are here because this is a medium for sharing in perpetuity. In the last couple of years, on the cusp of our third decade of practice, we have watched with awe and delight a renaissance in generative work as it's adopted by an entirely new generation around blockchain technologies. This inspired us to enter this new space with our own enduring questions of form and geometry, modularity and variability, historical continuity, and the thirst for endlessness. Primitives is what we selected as our primer into generative art on-chain because both the work and the medium grapple with these questions. \n\nSome Notes:\nOn the screen, Primitives is represented as a two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional figure. Each invocation comes with a sequence of projections, or rotations, around this object. As Primitives spins, there are moments when its blocks snap into alignment with other blocks  revealing its underlying lattice and crystalline nature.

It fires the slab in a digital kiln (it calls this “minting”) and through this act its art is preserved for millennia. The hand runs its fingers over the textured surface, feeling satisfaction at having spontaneously produced a piece of art so beautiful, expressive, and unique.\n\n---\n \nCeramics is a generative sculpture that mimics the physical expression of carving into clay.

It asserts that the value of handmade isn’t the time it takes to make the work nor the physical materials consumed, but the endless small decisions and serendipitous details that appear along the way, as can be felt in each Ceramics mint.\n\nDespite the handmade nature of Ceramics the outputs cannot be touched. Highly tactile images enchant the viewer to imagine their tangible representations, and leave them to dwell on their perception of materiality — both in the experiential physical world and conceptually-infinite digital space.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/9de6f9bae207a06ef4091efaa2287504.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

By considering the relationship between sound frequencies rather than musical notes, the piece explores the possibilities of harmony without the constraints of an instrument. \n\nUtilizing specific intervals which the human ear perceives as balanced, the algorithm creates a chord by computing a set of frequencies which are multiples or subdivisions of the interval. Combining this algorithm with the hash, Ratio produces a unique chord for each mint, with varying levels of tension, brightness, and microtonal deviation. \n\nThe sound field washes up against visuals which evoke streams of light falling across a series of panes. Sound data slowly illuminates and transforms the panes over time, creating a meditative respite for viewers. \n\nA full length fx(text) article about the theory behind Ratio is available here: https://bit.ly/ratio-theory\n\n\n~ Interaction ~\n\n- Press “f” to toggle fullscreen mode\n- Press “r” to record a 30-second video clip with audio. Use Safari for highest quality video and mp4 format. Chrome is next best but can only output the webm format (which you can then convert to mp4 via an online tool such as https://www.freeconvert.com/webm-to-mp4)\n- Press “1” to toggle between the generated chord and the closest possible match on a piano\n\n\n~ Aspect Ratio ~\n\nOutputs will automatically switch between landscape 16:9 or portrait 9:16 based on the size of your window. If you’d like to enforce a specific aspect ratio, you can append the parameter “?aspect=[number]” to an output’s URL. For instance, “[output_url]?aspect=1” will enforce a square aspect ratio regardless of the window size and fullscreen mode.\n\n\n~ About Night Sea ~\n\nRatio is the second generative audiovisual project by Night Sea, following their first release, l.o, on Art Blocks in September of 2023. Their other work includes Sonatina for Plotter and Laptop, presented at Art Blocks Marfa in 2023, a project exploring the sonic possibilities of a pen plotter.

Dive into stacks of deterministic layers to explore emerging patterns, and fine-tune the audio reactivity to your preferences.  \n\nYou may wish to use the controls to wander within Divergence until the aesthetic feels right to you, or complements your audio input.  Navigating the art in this way gives a tangible window into my artistic process.  My aesthetic is influenced by the music I listen to as I code. I enjoy experimenting and looking for the art in the algorithm.  This can mean playing with overarching ideas, but also making many small changes until I find consistent visual appeal over a range of outputs.  \n\nDivergence exhibits animations changing over time in expanding, textural layers.  It elaborates on concepts I’ve developed in previous works: my approach to color in phase; linear motion in Parade; interlacing lines and expansion/contraction in Kaleidoscope; and the noise textures of Sift.  Newly explored is continuous animation with touch and audio inputs, which affect the viewing position in time and space.  \n\nA common quip in the Art Blocks community is that motion art has a penalty. Many enjoy a final product that is printable to frame at home.  As technology advances, I believe it is equally important to create work that can only exist on a screen, and is unique to digital art. Larger displays are catching up to the artistic space and becoming more accessible, but I also want my work to be approachable immediately.  Keeping the code lean and performant allows it to run well on a range of screen sizes and processor powers, from mobile devices to multi-story displays.  There has been discussion that a body of motion work takes a long time to sift through, as it needs to be viewed live.  In consideration of this, I made Divergence immersive, rather than a static experience. I want the extra time spent with it to be fun and entertaining.  \n\nUsage: Navigate left/right to traverse the timeline; navigate up/down to travel through the layers and expand/contract the patterns.  Please see “Display Notes” for further instructions (user input, audio reactivity, url parameters).  Accessibility is important to me, so Divergence accepts inputs from touch, keyboard, mouse, and gaming controllers with an analog stick.  \n\n*Photosensitive seizure warning: These artworks contain flashing colors and moving patterns.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/eda0dc121335f246d052bac60dfa18ac.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

Whether it's on a personal level, with constantly evolving relationships, or on a larger scale, with natural disasters, pandemics, and wars that disrupt our lives, chaos is a constant companion. But chaos doesn't always have to be negative; it can also bring unexpected beauty and moments of clarity if we're willing to take a closer look.\n\n\nFor artists, chaos can be a powerful tool in creative expression. Long-form generative art is a unique way to incorporate randomness into artwork, allowing for the creation of a series of distinct pieces based on the same code. Seasky is an example of this, with its prominent display of the construction process, showcasing the creation of clouds that seek to dominate the scene. The interplay between light, clouds and sea adds depth and intrigue to the piece. As the scene evolves, the inclusion of noise on the horizon and soaring birds creates an emotive and captivating view.\n\n\nSeasky was born from my exploration of the realm of chaos. As an artist, I love to experiment with generative art code, and during the creation of this collection, I discovered an unconventional method of creating clouds by layering objects at specific intervals. Pushing the limits of this technique, I found myself drawn to clouds that started to resemble painterly styles by 19th century masters such as JMW Turner and Gustave Courbet. For me, these styles emanated a sense of power and emotion that other constructs using this technique could not match.

How some of them are small, fleeting and ephemeral while a select few become lifelong bonds. The work examines the intricate graphs that are formed by these connections. Graphs are all around us and have existed for as long as we have been human. From early settlements of hunter-gatherers and nomadic tribes to the internet of today. It's all graphs.\n\nNära allows the viewer to explore and experience these graphs as a metaphor for the organic, organised chaos that is life. Shapes connect from one node in a graph to the next, sometimes spilling over, doubling down and creating layers of intricacy. Imperfection is embraced and Nära exposes the chaotic and unpredictable elements of life. \n\nThe artistic vision of Nära is to highlight and expose graphs in a tactile manner that allows the viewer to see the whole graph, but also engage with the details and texture.  In doing this, Nära attempts to bring a novel contribution by pushing the boundaries of graph representation and introducing an emotional dimension to this oftentimes rigid and scientific discipline. By treating graphs as a metaphor for relationships in life, they become an integral part of the concept and an important artistic tool. \n\nNära takes inspiration from the De Stijl movement in reducing the world into a deliberate expression in its smallest form and builds upon the use of shapes imbued with meaning in the works of Hilma af Klint. These ideas are expanded on by accepting that what is deliberate must also relinquish some control through the pseudo-randomness of generative art. This invites reflection on the balance of control and chance in our lives. \n\n_Through Nära, you are invited to reflect on the connections in your own life and on the significance of the relationships that define us as human beings._ \n\nTo interact with the script:\n- Press 's' to save.\n- Add the following to the URL:\n  - pd=x, where x is a number to control the resolution via pixel density (useful for rendering high resolution stills)\n  - rs=x, where x is a number to enable and control the rendering buildup animation.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/e806ad9010186cb75e84ae5080a33438.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

Witnessing the vast fields of yuccas flowering simultaneously and watching the sunrise over Judd's 100 untitled works in mill aluminum are two specific moments that will never leave my memory. Combining these two sensations resulted in generative arrangements of yuccas and boxes.\n## Edge of the desert\nThe city of Marfa is on the northeast side of the Chihuahuan desert. The weather is dry and hot in the summer. Plants that grow naturally in the region, like the yucca, have adapted well to the harsh conditions.\n## Soaptrees\nIn the Americas, there are a lot of different types of yucca. The type of yucca that grows in and around Marfa is called yucca elata, which is also known as the soaptree yucca. These yuccas grow very slowly, only about an inch per year. Yucca elata doesn't always bloom, but when it does, the flowers come out between May and June.\n## Sunrise at Chinati\nThe Chinati Foundation is a museum in Marfa based on Donald Judd's ideas. The focus is on works that have a strong connection to the land around them. Sometimes a special event called \"Sunrise at Chinati\" is held at the museum so that people can see the many works in the golden light of the morning sun.\n# An SVG is available!\nThe SVG is a fully scalable resolution agnostic version of the image.

Connected together and surrounding us on all sides, their framings and displays have also opened, activated, and added another spatiotemporal dimension to the four in which all of us live.*\n—Vivian Sobchack, *From Screen-Scape to Screen-Sphere: A Meditation in Medias Res*\n\nAn exploration of a technical concept I call \"pixel overpainting.\"\n\nRasterized procedural brush strokes with low transparency slowly layer themselves over each other in a rhythmic loop until they achieve colorful equilibrium. They continue to overpaint themselves endlessly. The resulting color mixtures are then quantized and dithered to separate them into patches of pixels that recall the discrete materiality of the screen: a strictly digital variation on color field painting. The resulting texture is not a skeuomorphic grain but an overt reference to the universe of screens that surround us every day. Electric light arranged in a grid, fluttering and flickering everywhere all the time.\n\nPlease allow a few minutes for the colors to reach equilibrium.\nFor best results use Chrome browser with enabled webGL and hardware acceleration. Though it is encouraged to explore the subtleties in viewing the same pixels on different hardware and software to reflect on the subjectivity of contemporary computer graphics and the materiality of CPUs, GPUs, resolutions, pixel densities, browser APIs, and other medium-specific entropy.\n\nPress '1', '2', '4', '8' to change pixel sizes.\nPress 'p' or click canvas to pause/resume.\nPress 's' to grab a still frame.\nPress 'r' to re-paint.\n\nCollectors will be eligible to receive a signed giclée print of a still frame of their mint as well as high-resolution looping media in GIF or lossless video format.\n```\n░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░\n```", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gLEQR-c0H7YLtkUXpBOhzMCGE7QncMcWVdEiHT6do3QAFCKURU_TUp5P9megPjnrq0D9uO58d5qSFRuwhIjRY7RH287xu3qzJL9Y"},

There are only interpretations._\n\nGlass is about the illusion of simplicity that cocoons us in our everyday existence. A glance at Glass may suggest a foam of bubbles or pebbles under clear water. But on inspection, these simple pictures dissolve. Instead of disks one finds stacked panes of translucent glass, intersecting and overlapping. There is dissonance between fine-scale chaos and the harmony of the aggregate. In Glass, two levels of reality -- panes of glass and the foam of bubbles -- are brought close together in scale, so that our oversimplified impression yields a palpable disquiet.\n\nWhat appears simple is often anything but. Consider a standard wooden desk. To our eyes, it looks solid and continuous, but we know that it is made of atoms, tiny electrons orbiting nuclei. And these subatomic particles are themselves not like miniature solar systems, but creatures of quantum mechanics, stranger than we can imagine. The vast difference in scale between the atomic and the macroscopic hides this complex reality, but fundamentally it is the same phenomenon shown here.\n\nGlass continues my exploration of emergence. While in previous work I explored how simple systems can create complex, emergent forms, here the interest is in the converse: how coherence is often deceptive, masking a complex underlying reality.\n\nGlass draws on the aesthetic of Shin Hanga artists Hiroshi Yoshida and Kawase Hasui, and abstract expressionist Sonja Sekula. In live view, Glass has ambient motion: the shadows evolve, imperceptibly slowly.\n\nThe following variations & controls are possible. You may need to click on the canvas before they are active. For a high-resolution output, use the pixel density controls. For example, on a standard laptop, an image saved at pixel density 5 will be approximately 3200 x 4000 pixels, and therefore suitable for printing at ~ 11\" x 13\" at 300 dpi.\n\nVariations (require redrawing):\n\nf -- fit-to-screen on/off\no -- outline on/off\n\nControls:\n\ns   -- save as png\nspacebar  -- pause/unpause ( useful to reduce CPU load in Live mode )\nb -- border on/off ( useful for printing )\n1-9  -- set pixel density (default=2 on retina displays)\n+/-  -- increase/decrease pixel density", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lY45xy95wVah0ggajJ7XMaNgfFEHEADIKEhTaHGIlAfIsLbZJ97US5asFQTkAlikPFeOUZ18GttYLNSc6HAx9UR1X5_RVVAaRBk"},

Go to the center to close the interference. Go to the edges to open it.\nDouble click change mode (Auto - Tactil )\n\nINTERFERENCES is about reordering the elements, altering the parts that make up the shapes and identifying the possibilities of color ordering.\nHere, the variability is found in the subtle, seeking to challenge the sensitive vision of the viewer, generating displacement effects, or simply proposing a minimal visual design.\n\nInterferences is an excuse to return to color theories from the Bauhaus and Latin American cinetics artist, that made up the artistic avant-garde of the 1950s. From there, the project seeks to continue developing on the relative characteristics of color: those situations in which our experience of the color changes according to the context. How to use color? It's not what colors, but how colors are used that define artists.\n\nThe instability appears as a game in the work on the form, breaking out the circle as a standard of harmony and perfection. How far can you continue to recognize a shape? It is this instability that suggests movement, like a photograph of a moment in the sequence, waiting to be completed.\n\nWhat characteristics does the work of art of web3.0 must have? That was one of the questions that motivated this work. There could be several answers, but I think one of them would definitely have to do with the possibility of change: is not a jpg, is not a .mov: it is a piece of software that you can touch and modify, find new possible outputs and play with variability.\n\nInterferences is a project of #purevisibility: there is no message.

It contains artworks within artworks, found by puzzles inside other puzzles. One leading to another. At the center is a gateway. The gateway opens another world. That world is an Alternate Reality Game filled with cryptic histories, untold stories, and physical treasures hidden all over the world. \n\nTo begin, some hints. The solution to the first puzzle is a three-part key. It leads to another layer. Here is a room of sorts. An escape room. Viewable from three angles. In the room are eight code-words. They lead to the way out. Collaboration is essential.\n\nAt the bottom of Crypt is another key. It unlocks a world.

Set in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the game begins with a series of audio tracks. Some tracks are musical compositions, others are filled with odd voices reading letters and counting numbers, others still resemble nothing more than noise and static.\n \nEach track is, in fact, a puzzle of increasing complexity. As players work together to solve them, a narrative about early research into psychological operations, mind-control experiments, and an alternative history of the internet age begins to emerge. Over the course of the game, players come across - and are invited to collect - a series of artworks specifically created for Cyclops players. To find these artworks, players must identify and follow up on clues provided within the game.

Striping and stippling, swooping and darting; noisy automatism contrasted with coded instinct. \nGestural abstraction applied with simulation of brush and emulation of media.

Empiricism describes the world, while rationalism explains it. This conflict has been at the core of me throughout my studies, and I explore the idea further in this project.\n\nDipolar tries to answer the question \"What would electromagnetism look like in two dimensions?\", itself rich in the ideas of rationalism. To an empiricist, it is a question which can not be answered, but the answer has impacts throughout physics, from 3D electromagnetism to condensed matter. These questions and those like them have been grappled with for thousands of years, and we will die without knowing if our attempts at answers will be seen any differently from Plato's theory of Forms.\n\nOur three-dimensional universe constrains by its symmetry the behaviour of point charges to the radial fields that we are used to. In two dimensions the fields can curl around the charge, leading to two kinds of fields able to be produced by a charge. When paired with another particle of the same type and equal but opposite charge they create a 'dipole moment', which look alike when composed of either type of charge. Dipolar shows the field profiles produced by these combinations for each type, and as an idealised 'point dipole'.\n\nThe style was inspired by the sketches of Euler and da Vinci. Both were revolutionary minds, they sought to understand and explain the world in diagram, a tradition that has been preserved in art and science to this day. More broadly, I've felt inspired by Sol Lewitt and Vera Molnar, in particular their use of dense detail, seeing how it can provide tension in their work and draw the viewer in closer.\n\n*An SVG for plotting can be downloaded by pressing DOWN*\n*A 4096x4096 image can be downloaded by pressing UP*\n*Plotting speed can be adjusted with LEFT/RIGHT*\n*The animation can be restarted with SPACE*", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NteiZgET7b7vFP9e77QAcbu3AAD2X5J8GqwvTh7zzWkxYhklSAw_a25iCQ51esedRlpSRRL758d7WjT3Hje7_apB9uYE7lOcrg"},

The project tells a story of the tragic end of all existence in a distant universe, long since forgotten. Any given individual output depicts a passing moment, captured during the final breath of each dying world. The once peaceful landscapes were torn apart, deforming and reshaping their natural geometries and thus the reality itself in a surrealistic fashion.\n\nEach image is drawn to vaguely mimic a pencil-like texture. Firstly to remind of something familiar and subsequently emitting a peculiar and eerie feeling. Did this event happen and was it witnessed by a carbon-based life-form?\n\nThe project invites the viewer to ponder the different scenarios of what might have transpired in the past that lead the universe to its doom. Although one interpretation can be deciphered from the partially corrupted transmission below, it is not necessarily the true explanation.\n\n\nThe only thing that is known, is that all life ceased to exist in this ancient universe long time ago. Its tale lives on, but only as a memory and as a reminder to us all that life can be fragile and fleeting, albeit beautiful and precious.\n\n## The Story\n\n*”If anyone listens .. …. recording …. ….. ….. .. a warning …. …. will happen .. your world. We didn’t …. …. .. our universe, ……. we drained … ….. resource ….. .. couldn’t sustain … life …. any longer. The great collapse .. moments away … this will .. … end .. our story. Do not …… our mistakes. Most importantly … …. prevent ….. …. ……… ….. world .. … ……. ……… at any cost. This is our final transmission.”*\n\nJust as the transmission ends, a sudden flash of dreamlike images flashes through your mind, leaving a vivid imprint. These were the final moments of an ancient, distant and long forgotten universe. The rush is too much to handle and you faint. You wake up and immediately start looking for the recording but it's gone. You remember everything as clear as day, but was it just a dream?\n\n## The Details\n\nThere are several main scenes, which depict the specific stage that the end has advanced to. The predominantly or entirely black and white and the muted palettes give a sense of silence and solitude. Meanwhile other palettes disturb that calmness. Some palettes remind of colors in nature, but most are chosen and used in unnatural manner touching the style of expressionism.\n\nPressing \"s\" saves a screenshot at any point during the rendering. Pressing \"p\" pauses and unpauses the rendering. Pressing up or down arrow increases or decreases the drawing animation speed.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/7c5741f4c487aae381bba2a2e1f11923.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

He was my first teacher and I lost him at the age of 52. He was not killed in these wars but in the end I believe it was the wars that killed him. On March 11th, I was able to celebrate my 52nd birthday, the age he was when he so unexpectedly passed away in 1981. This is when I made a decision that would change the course of my life: I would keep his cameras, become a photographer, and continue his legacy. “52icons” is a personal collection of 1/1 portraits (+1879 Iggys) that capture some of the most famous faces of our time, including my father, forever in my heart and now forever living on the blockchain.

The project continues my reflection on physical and significant spaces, which started with previous projects \"Stipple Sunsets\", \"Patchwork Saguaros\", and \"Speckled Summits\". \n\nIn these three prior works, I looked to capture the essence of the \"escape of the beach\", the \"home I grew up in\" of the Sonoran desert, and the \"home I find now\" in the Rocky Mountains. \"Sonoran Roadways\" continues this arc, reflecting similar active appreciation of space and place found in the transition of travel.\n\nThe style and technique of \"Sonoran Roadways\" is homage to stencil-like qualities of silkscreen printmaking. As the grandson of two artists who worked in the mediums of printmaking, paper cutting, and quilt making, I strive to incorporate the qualities of these mediums into my stipple-based digital paintings.\n\nAdditional approaches are pulled from my abstract experimentation in \"Dot Matrix Gradient Study\" with distortion and \"digital misprinting\" applied to the stipple matrices, but with a return to a figurative form.\n\nPalettes used in \"Sonoran Roadways\" are largely inspired by Arizona's scenic drives and fantastical multi-colored sunsets – peaceful and familiar to me. \n\n\"Sonoran Roadways\" is a call to appreciate the potentially mundane, and get lost in the imagination of the journey back to somewhere called home or the fantasy of an exploration to somewhere new.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Isj-RJyheJVO2Uw0NppmdwoPUFY2KrqiqZaKyI4lZFoRCJs4lKjWqItrPLt5IWIbsrNjWx508Q4Y1nuhy3Jw0wWIeGtUHQ3fdk"},

In projects that involve tracking down covert CIA operations, analyzing NSA surveillance programs, or dissecting harmful AI systems, I’ve always been interested in the numerous methods humans have developed to hide secrets and the ingenious ways others have created to expose them.\n \nFor the PRELUDES works, I challenged myself to think about how one could hide secrets using the particularities of an entirely on-chain medium. While the blockchain’s underlying technology, of course, relies on the same types of cryptography used by intelligence agencies, secure banking systems, and other entities, the question of how to hide something in a medium where everything is visible poses a particular type of problem. I went back to my early training as a composer to find an answer.\n \nThe PRELUDES NFTs are musical compositions that hide secrets. On one hand, they’re inspired by the pioneers of algorithmically generated music such as John Cage and Iannis Xenakis. On the other, they’re inspired by composers such as Michael Haydn, Johannes Brahms, and Olivier Messiaen, who developed systems for encoding messages into their music.\n \nLurking in each of the PRELUDES NFTs is a secret.\n \nPRELUDES holders who solve the puzzle are entitled to a limited edition of the upcoming CYCLOPS vinyl LP and gelatin-silver print of a “numbers station” I photographed in a remote corner of Europe.* Visit: https://cyclopsgroup.art with your three word solution to the puzzle to claim your LP.\n\nPm fvb hyl ylhkpun aopz, fvb ohcl ahrlu fvby mpyza zalw puav h shynly dvysk.

The conflict between intrinsic meaninglessness and our search for meaning is both absurd and liberating. We are free to create our own meaning yet ultimately, there is none. By acknowledging both the futility and the opportunity, we can find joy.\n\nThese images have no specific meaning yet often they seem purposed. Each output evokes an emotional tone, such as calm, erratic, troubled, bold, mysterious or cheerful. We are frequently reminded of something or can identify shapes like birds, houses or spaceships. Our innate tendency to find patterns and meaning is evident.\n\nThe algorithm uses geometry and rules but has been given as much freedom as possible to create varied compositions which contain both chaos and order. The compositions are constructed using node layouts, which are connected to form shapes. Connection is a recurrent theme in our pursuit of meaning - manifested in pattern formation, our relationships and the interconnectedness of the universe. The shapes are duplicated and modified through rotation, mirroring, and scaling to build up structure and chaotic form. If an output appears too sparse, an extra stage of manipulation is applied. Keypresses reveal the components, allowing viewers to observe the underlying mathematical structure of the composition. How does this insight influence our perception of meaning?\n\nThe meaning communicated by each piece is subjective, shaped by the viewer's own experiences interacting with the work. The artist aspires to connect with her audience by discovering the meanings they derive from the outputs we have yet to encounter.\n\nToggle components - \n1 - Nodes\n2 - Shapes\n3 - Extras\n4 - Strokes or Outlines (if present)\n5 - Border\nr - Return to full piece\n\ns - Save 2000px wide image\np - Save 5000px wide image", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZIienlbwMlUq8EMwyVeCgnwisxd_dPjlZxwufo1OiZYyZDPZWptzgAAgZMJRVpcFkD38l4RHi5O8rA0qEHVVDknss32UcBc07uQ"},

This saturation is often accompanied by a sense of disorientation and fragmentation, making it challenging to extract meaningful and valuable insights. As humanity progresses and evolves, this gap between our biological, cognitive, and perceptual capacities and the rapid advancements of our digital world becomes increasingly significant.\n\nInfinity, chaos, complexity, self-reproducibility, coherence, and layering are epithets that apply to this work.\n\nThis artwork seeks to capture the complexity and chaos of our digital existence, utilizing various visual techniques to convey its message. Layering and fragmentation visually depict the scattered and fragmented nature of our digital lives, with each layer representing a different unit of information. This fragmentation is further underscored by the grid of \"transport\" lines that permeate the canvas, symbolizing the interconnected networks and corporations that seek to control and manipulate our attention. Despite the strict rules governing the forms in the artwork, the overall effect is one of chaos and impending tragedy. This tension between order and disorder is a recurring theme, conveying that we are on the brink of losing control and being consumed by information overload. The visual elements of the artwork convey a \"technological coldness\" and emotionlessness, reflecting the detachment that can result from our immersion in the digital realm. Some of the elements are unfocused, which creates the effect of discomfort and the inability to concentrate and embrace all the available space at once. A kind of frame is the \"traces\" of data gathering toward the center - in our minds - and intertwining into an endless tangle of something massive and noisy but with no precise shape.\n\nTo reinforce the concept, I placed an infinite rotation of all the layers used in the art behind the main canvas. They alternate at great speed, constantly changing their \"compression\" and background, symbolizing the endless flow of digital information overwhelming our consciousness.\n\nThrough its visual elements and composition, the artwork urges us to reflect on our collective responsibility to engage with technology more ethically and thoughtfully. It reminds us that while technology can offer many opportunities and benefits, it also significantly challenges our values and ethics. In this sense, the artwork serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining a balance between technological progress and human values.\n\nI used many techniques to create this art. Because of the large number of generated elements and big canvas size, it takes quite a long time to make, \"overloading\" your device and then entirely using its resources, which is also part of the concept.\n\n---\n\nThis art is static until you touch it. You can use the mouse wheel to examine the details, and you can also drag the surface of the art. Also, this art is created in two parts. Behind it is an infinite rotation of the layers used in it.\n\n**Controls:** \n\nMouse wheel: zoom in/out\nMouse click, hold and move: drag the static part\nMouse double-click: reset (go static)\nPress 's' to save the image\n\nWARNING: PHOTOSENSITIVITY/EPILEPSY SEIZURES\n\n---\n\n ***As always, a pre-sale for TBOA club members and TBOA token holders will be a day before the official release.***", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/R4xWgsvBLEks6Dwi5JwAfX-z6fcPvctTnLe982ZwZQRSDzuv8EzdFixmMYV38MOKjR-Pmmpki20l2VBCJs29qPpIv9x2loEcDo0Q"},

As the layers all possess some level of transparency, light passes through the paint, hitting the canvas and reflecting back toward the viewer. This creates an otherworldly, glowing, living effect that is inimitable by any other means. The nature of the technique requires a tremendous amount of time--the more glazes, the more rich and beautiful the effect--and is very unforgiving of mistakes. The artist that dedicates to this slow, careful, path--to return, again and again, layer after layer, week after week--will bring a rare and singular beauty into the world.\r\n\r\n*This collection features an Open Edition, a 24-hour [1/1 Auction](https://www.niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x464436fa5a31b0923922d56d6e755e53927260b6/1), a [100 edition FCFS](https://www.niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x464436fa5a31b0923922d56d6e755e53927260b6/2) (for previous collectors only), and an exclusive [airdrop](https://www.niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x464436fa5a31b0923922d56d6e755e53927260b6/3) (for Claire Silver's 1/1 holders).

They are the farthest man crafted objects from Earth. It will take tens to hundreds thousands years for them to reach other stars and planetary systems despite a velocity of 17km/s... \nThe on-board camera, mysteriously, sends back images of the remote planets and their moons...\n\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\nDylan Thomas (Do not go gentle into that good night)\n\nARTWORK DESCRIPTION\n\nThe artwork represents a planet and its moons. There is an important variety of planet/moons types, different perspectives (far or near the planet and moons), different space environments (stars, Milky Way, star clusters,  comet, eclipse, Einstein cross and ring, Magellanic Clouds...). A very rare Gravitational Wave affecting space properties can occur. Usually Monochromatic, there is a variation with the addition of one color. In \"live view\" use the interaction possibilities to explore a given planetary system...\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\n\nIn the same way photons hit the CCD camera, tiny squares hit the canvas.\nThe algorithm is minimalist : pick a random position in the canvas and decide if a monochromatic tiny square has to be drawn or not (rarely, squares can be drawn in 2 colors). The light parts are drawn only through the absence of drawing. The whole complexity resides in the decision to draw or not to draw. Mathematical functions are underneath each decision, like space and time are underneath all of our world. \n\n\nINTERACTIONS\n\nYou can interact with keyboard commands or through URL parameters.\n- press S : to save the current image in png\n- press 2, 3... 9 (URL, add DP=2) : change resolution. Increase the value step by step. Can be very long to draw, but it's worth it for printing. Very High Resolution can be achieved. The file is saved automatically when finished.\n- press L (URL, add liveMode=true) : to discover different views of your planetary system (images will be drawn one after the other, with the same parameters for the main planet and the space environment).\n- press F (URL, add fitToScreen=true) : to adapt the artwork to any screen size (artwork is changed but parameters remain the same)\n- press M (URL, add monoChromatic=true) : to force the artwork to be monochromatic\n- press G (URL, add GW=false) : to remove the gravitational wave effect\n- URL, add offset=<Number>, to offset the image production (same planet parameters and space environment)\n- URL, add grainy=true, to change the size of the grain (useful for displays to speed up the creation process)\n\nURL Parameters are added to the end of a URL after a ‘?’ symbol, and multiple parameters can be included when separated by the ‘&’ symbol.\nYou can combine \"?liveMode=true&fitToScreen=true&grainy=true\" in the URL for display purpose (TV, Art show...). \nCombining liveMode and DP for resolution allows you to save all the images produced.\n\n\nEXTERNAL LICENSE\n\nVoyager is built with p5js and a simplex noise library under MIT license: simplex-noise.js.\n\n\nDISRUPTED STAR\n\nI am a French astrophysicist (PhD) working in high energy astrophysics.\nMy artist name is related to an astrophysical event in which a star, a pretty common object in the Universe,  comes too close to a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH), is torn apart and finally tidally disrupted...\nThe Generative Art plays the role of the SMBH that has changed my life in many ways in the past years...", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/e9cfd42799ba7ae5f495bb8158faa265.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

Inspired by starling murmurations, the repetition of a line, dot, or ring forms a flock of flickering particles rippling across the canvas. Interconnected audio and visual patterns create a mesmerizing display of echoes and modulations. As the sound expands and contracts, so do the areas of visual density, revealing ephemeral shapes and structures. Sounds become visible. Visuals become audible.\n\nWithin the sonic component, filters and echoes manipulate a sustained chord until subtle melodies and rhythmic structures appear, resulting in a hypnotic and evolving soundscape unfolding from an elementary source. The signal path relies solely on bespoke code built using Web Audio, including an implementation of an early computer music algorithm called *Karplus-Strong* which utilizes tuned delay lines to simulate the physics of stringed instruments. The audio effect design is also inspired by the magical warmth of vintage analog equipment like tape loop echo units. This analog quality found its way into the visual style: the low frame rate gives the project a hand animated feel reminiscent of stop motion.\n\nOn our last album, [Still](https://silentseason.bandcamp.com/album/still), we questioned the repetitive experience of pedestrian life, attempting to invoke wonder in the constantly evolving nature of our world, even in moments of perceived stillness. *l.o* expands this line of inquiry, inviting the audience to appreciate the compounding complexity surfacing from a succession of small shifts within a fixed pattern. As the series builds, various directions of color, shape, tone and tempo are unveiled.\n\nAlongside works like *Flux* by Owen Moore, or *montreal friend scale* by Amon Tobin, the project explores core questions about the audiovisual medium: can it be more than visuals in the service of sound, or sound in the service of visuals? How can the synthesis of the two media create a richer whole? While the sound of *Flux* reacts to visual data, and *montreal friend scale* is a literal visual representation of a sonic concept, *l.o* features a two-way dialogue between sound and visuals. The two are interconnected through 9 different paths, including a key relationship where filter frequency modulates flock density (more details available in the [AV section](https://l.o.night-sea.com/#av) of the project’s website). This audiovisual conversation offers a unique encounter between generative visual art and abstract electronic music, two vibrant spaces that share a common thread.\n\nKey controls are available to explore the different components building the final sound:\n\n- Press ‘0’ to turn off all effects and hear the initial sustained chord\n- Press ‘1’ to toggle back on / off the amplitude modulation (can sound subtle in certain outputs)\n- Press ‘2’ to toggle back on / off the filtering effects\n- Press ‘3’ to toggle back on / off the echo based effects\n- Press ‘Space’ to pause / resume the piece\n\nAfter pressing ‘0’, pressing successively ‘1’, ‘2’ and ‘3’ will bring the piece back to the original audio setup.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fDCRUjlRLABYcrlEMvBYIVL7KaggfOLVU8tjRF1ZIE01QrvjlVQc2Qot1iov25E3VhSfPX01ER50sYY4ewv4U14fvSupsDfY0ak"},

They are used widely in architecture, product design, and perhaps most familiarly in user interfaces. Think: desktop icons like trash cans or notepads. SKEUOMORPHS is a meditation on this digital tradition. \n\nSKEUOMORPHS picks up where RASTER left off as an another exploration of the materiality of pixels and rasterized imagery. Here the study of pixels narrows in on the shallow depth of on-screen interfaces and the play of low-res figure-ground effects. Moments of skeuomorphism where the 2-dimensional plane of the screen becomes slightly 3-dimensional through beveling or drop-shadows are extracted and used as abstract painterly details. These elements that are typically used to make computation and interfaces more familiar become unfamiliar on the canvas, suggesting the possibility of an aesthetic between abstraction and realism.\n\nSKEUOMORPHS employs recurring themes and techniques from my art practice: limited color palettes, low-res chunky pixels, dithering, and physics simulation. It uses a specific kind of dithering called R-sequence dither developed by Martin Roberts. Like traditional Bayer matrix-based dithering, this technique produces a patterned image akin to retro video games and early computer screens. In this project, the R-dither pattern results in a woven textile-like texture, which recalls the long relationship between computing and weaving. The canvas negotiates two scales simultaneously: that of the dithered pixel (rendered at 1/1024th of the canvas height) and the simulated particle that acts as a brush stroke (rendered at 1/256th of the canvas height). The two resolutions work together to produce a cohesive texture that is neither pretending to be a retrograde screen nor an analog material but something in between. Similar to RASTER, the goal is to investigate new avenues for digital aesthetics that rely on a combination of historical techniques and innovative practices.\n\nUse mouse or touch controls to interact.\nPress 's' to grab a still frame.\n\nCollectors will be eligible to receive a signed archival giclée print of their mint.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2KwF-XnOMvzoC83O9HFJ48h5z0TlCaRJ33raDUPX47a58rw4AdHucVJJjX5k2GVC3HbfadtTndcWbXxGLTo2L5g8o-RByKG3Gg"},

Hold on! Hold on!\nI like to think of my brain as a hand,\npalm of my soul, fragile nerve bundle.\nI think about my brain as I hold my heart\nin both hands — a private thing, a pulsing secret.\nIt fills my palms and bones with heat.\nThe world is full of heartbeat.\nI am trying to hold it all together...*\n    &nbsp; -- &nbsp;Excerpt from *STILL MOVING*, by Technelegy\n\n**NOTE: To fully experience *STILL MOVING*, please open in LIVE VIEW and enable your webcam for motion tracking.**\n\nThe first project of its kind, *STILL MOVING* is an interactive poem about humanity’s visceral engagement with the virtual – written and published via the blockchain as a token word performance, and embodied by each collector as a uniquely intimate, personalized interpretation. In this epic on-chain ode to the relationship of bodies and machines, literal and figurative wordplay activates the liminal space between text and reader, extending the two-dimensional screen/page into a somatic, material realm where language moves us in every sense of that phrase – up, down, sideways, forwards, backwards, and in otherwise inexpressible directions – urging us to reclaim our dynamism and intuitive physicality in an age of technological acceleration, bodily inertia, and rote gestures.\n\nA collaboration between Nathaniel Stern and Sasha Stiles – rooted in Stiles’ AI-powered verse and Stern’s career in digital, interactive, and networked art – *STILL MOVING* is an ars poetica about what it means to be a human body facing a machine: a showdown, a form of worship, a distraction, a mirror gaze, an other, an alter, an alter. After we bend to our technologies, do we spring back into shape, or assume new forms? Where does input end, and output begin? As we continue to think, work, and play faster than ever while rooted in place, it is still possible to be moved – *really* moved?\n\n*STILL MOVING* also embodies the future of web3 literature, in which the book – read-only – evolves into a read-write-interact experience, and authors begin to adopt such tools as webcams and NFTs in their writerly arsenal. In each unique edition of *STILL MOVING*, camera-based motion tracking (data confined to your local machine only) facilitates a play-full and meaning-full interface between the reader’s physical self and language on screen. Human forms and gestures shape machine expression, and vice versa, cybernetic serendipity inspires poetic association. Make a move, and be moved… Stand still, and instill meaning…\n\nPalettes pair paper, charcoal, and pencil colorings – emblematic of the stationery/stationary – with neon and electric highlights that nod to computational restlessness. Preview images feature lines from the core poem, potent standalone phrases, or rare, gestural graphics and images, caught somewhere between language and illustration, expression and wordless apprehension. \n\n\n**FUNCTIONS**\n\n*Click inside the interaction area if any of the function keys below are not working.*\n\n*Space Bar* to toggle Play/Pause the interaction and animation\n\n*'d'* Downloads the current image at the screen/browser resolution\n\n*Up/Down arrows* increase/decrease camera sensitivity by 5\n(for use in high and low light situations;\n0-150, default is 90; higher numbers = more text)\n\n*Top two keyboard rows (numbers 1 thru 0 and letters q thru p)* also birth semi-mapped text\n\n*'c'* toggles Camera use (if present and on) between keyboard only or both\n\n*'v'* Views/hides the Verse (your poetry / your iteration’s text)\n\n*'f'* toggles Full screen (Live View only)\n\n*'s'* downloads / Saves the entire AI poem to the hard drive", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OfAs5WHwiE7AlYbqQfOG6xThpi5tj1t0q_0LHMSbFFKh_s7m310qpYXsvEiV8CeNopvhX0MqYxipevuUCQ6ra1qKbFL83oC2L-U"},

I started a slow introspection on the subject, and at the end of the year, I released “Foundations”, a series that focuses on the origins of our identity.\n\n“Tout tracé” is the second act, and its direct continuity. \nIn French, it means *“All mapped out”*, referring to the idea of an all planned future or *“a ready made path”.*\n\nThis series is the counterpoint of this vision. \n\nLife is full of surprises, good or bad, and each moment will have an impact on us, creating our set of experiences, many of them involuntary and embedded in our existence.\nAs humans, we are in constant evolution and therefore, on a quest of identity; of who we really are.\nWe are surrounded by expectations : from society, culture, religion, parents, friends, family… A list of rules that need to be followed and lived by; but, at the end of the day, I believe that only our choices matter.\n\nLike “Foundations”, the composition of “Tout tracé” is grid based: full of boxes expected to be filled.\nBut this series is about growth, evolution, expression and re-definition. It’s about fighting against the structure in place, finding our own voice and re-shaping our reality.\nIt is finding its uniqueness and identity that will be revealed through the millions of lines drawing each artwork, technically signing the idea of “Tout tracé”, that comes with a double meaning: *“All drawn”*.\n\n\n--\n- **Press ‘S’** to export a still image.\n- **Press ‘H’** to open a new tab of the artwork in HD (A3 format).\n\n-- \n\nOpening one output in fullscreen or in live view will run an animation revealing the artwork.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LGePFIF9DcSYNE5dSM2wnxL5DFBCHbJgUenWKVtubRYM9NdpIp6bC77KYFWGcz-77nZQiezIU4J3JDAuh4PiVtrwLdc6H9G77lE"},

These randomly generate simple musical timbres inspired by early computer sound chips. 🌴 The music itself is generated by randomly selecting 3 patterns out of a pool of 180. These patterns, which are little 8-bar music pieces, were written in the same C# Dorian scale so they always fit together. This is a pleasant sounding minor and colorful scale that I believe fits the general vibe of Rafaël’s work. 🌲 Composition wise, channel 1 plays the bassline and channels 2 and 3 the melody, countermelody, arpeggios and harmonies. 🌳 The system changes the patterns each time they are played, reversing, speeding up or slowing down the pattern or changing the synthesizer channel they are played on. In essence the system infinitely randomly remixes the source melodies to create ever new surprising pieces that harmonize with the colorful compositions.* 👈", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SBPdK2XmCqkfVW3aPmpHRf1aPu8cMti1Ol59w0H5tBJnWzLV7-gOqD-oM3enmZkbL7JkSUbnC6EN1kjW7ULBnQX9chIiFDpEew"},

This sense of structure is something that holds true to most of us individuals, communities, nations. However disorganised or frail one may be on the inside one often makes a substantial effort to appear structured, ordered. In other words our orderliness stems from the perception of that very orderliness.\n\nThe themes explored in my work are often a bi-product of my echoic memory in which I often pick up on background movie dialogues and tend to remember them by associating a colour and feeling to them. This in turn becomes an artistic direction, drawing inspiration from the sets, colours, location, time period, soundtrack, language and so on. The soundbite and evoked emotions guide the exploration and creation process.\nMore often than not the line from the movie becomes the title for the piece, as is the case for _Such A Lovely Time_.\n\n_Such A Lovely Time_ has a number of simple traits that when combined create intricate compositions.\n- Three different styles (Grid, Punch Card and Mixed) set the foundation.\n\t- The Grid style is based on a simple grid of elements with varying levels of density.\n\t- While the Punch Card style is essentially also a grid, it has a different rhythm to it, at times very sparse with isolated clusters, at other times those clusters and elements are connected together almost resembling sheet music. In some instances the Punch Card can be very dense almost to the point of saturation.\n\t- The Mixed style is a blend of the two aforementioned and introduces a higher degree of variations and somewhat unexpected results.\n\n- There are 16 palettes, each one of them named after a city. The colours are extracted from personal travel photos to those cities before being fine tuned.\n\n- The Cyrillic glyph is the centre piece of the composition, sometimes bold and in the foreground, at times fragmented and sometimes even hidden, as if an invitation to the viewer to look closer and explore the many layered details.\n\n- The other traits that make up the piece may have less depth in their meaning but add to the overall amount of graphical variations.\n\nEach iteration of _Such A Lovely Time_ is a generative attempt at technical aesthetics.\n\nCreated by petitsapin (Dominique McKerl Dautheribes).", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/37694fafcf405da629306be51fec3b59.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

A Seedling's natural environment–whether a grassy prairie, a rocky mountain, or by a river–is but a memory now, leaving a faded imprint on the canvas' outer border. Some Seedlings resemble trees and flowers, others may appear to be geometric abstractions and fractals–yet all feature interplay between filled patterned regions (leaves and petals) and lines of solid color (stems and branches). Other abstractions also make an appearance: circles representing fruits, stars, or the sun and moon; and a gradient sky with foggy clouds beyond the frames of the window.\n\n## Foundation\n\nThe idea for Seedlings was sown in 2019 and was my first foray into Generative Art. It began as a study of fractal trees where each depth level was individually parametrized (angle of rotation, length, etc.). Initially just a hobbyist project in the pre-Art Blocks era, I returned to Seedlings in 2022 to develop it into the longform series, I believe, that most effectively highlights the underlying algorithm's potential. So, I rewrote Seedlings from scratch, turning its simple monochromatic line renderer into a WebGL shader renderer capable of transforming Bézier curves into abstract stems, branches, leaves, and petals with diverse and colorful palettes.\n\n## Inspiration\n\nHaving lived much of my life in New York, one of the most urbanized cities in the world, I developed a significant appreciation for green spaces. The city's parks became a refuge from the urban sprawl–where one could touch some grass, breathe fresh air, and pretend they were somewhere else. In an attempt to fill more of my life with green, I placed some plants on my windowsill. The joy they bring my home inspired Seedlings.\n\nOver the course of its development, Seedlings collected many stylistic influences, including Hokusai's trees, Charles Demuth's crisscrossing polygonal regions, and Alphonse Mucha's curves. As such, you will find elements of Ukiyo-e and Art Nouveau across the collection. Seedlings also contains stylistic elements found in my other work, such as ink-like outlining and the concept of shape overlap.\n\nAdditionally, I drew inspiration from contemporary longform Generative Art that aims to create complex emergent behaviors from the interactions of a small set of primitives. The structural patterns that form each Seedling are created purely from the probabilistic placement of their branches and petals.\n\n## Dedication\n\nSeedlings has been a labor of love and has particular sentimental value to me as the inception of my Generative Art practice. It feels fitting and very exciting to be given the opportunity to release Seedlings on Art Blocks, the original longform Generative Art platform. Thank you to everyone who helped and supported me during this journey.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SRPGd5qhX37EGxDJT3mBlcVOrqRQVIq8XU-q9kachwE0LxNtig3X58b7WUJ7LP6rsH7cx7zpWpKzM_l7KlYUgN3nV5E5QkQ907Be"},

This nurtured conflicting perceptions of my public and private identify – a dilemma depicted in Semblance through a reimagination of the weavings and textiles from my childhood home.\n\nEach Semblance is a unique blend of color, diffusion, and environment. Its appearance is shaped by the suppression of a distinct focal point that dictates its context.

As Schiller argued, \"Man is human only when he plays\", because that is when creative imagination is completely unleashed.\n\nIn this perspective, our focus shifted from the final result to the acts that generate it. Disregarding any specific purpose, we lost ourselves in stacking, assembling, colouring simple shapes, and then again destroying and rebuilding, just like we used to do in childhood. Fun and discovery in the process were the purpose. \n\nWhile playing, the idea of network with its nodes and connections became stronger and stronger, but only in its broadest sense. It could evoke the image of branched-chain amino acids as well as the prototype of a boardgame, or even the complex structure of an entire city, whose elements converse and exchange flows of any kind. The continuous oscillation between abstract and figurative corresponds to the continuous oscillation of meaning, just as it happens in the playful dimension.\n\nWe keep interpreting these images differently every time we look at them. In any case, once \"work\" is done its author disappears, or at least no longer matters.

Some things we can only feel, but not understand. Some things touch us and move us deeply, but not physically. We can only confirm some things through experience.\n\nQi is believed to be part of everything that exists as a \"life force\" or \"spiritual energy\" that pervades the natural world. It cannot be seen, but in some paintings, the artist creates the flow of Qi to present a vivid world. Artists use Qi to show the presence of life in their artwork, and it’s also believed to be a metaphor for the energy that powers our body and spirit.\n\nMetaphysics is a generative system to simulate an organic world, to make the audience feel the Qi. Every single object is gradually deformed, shifted, and rotated in an attempt to find a pattern in the chaos that describes the workings of the life force and constitutes a living entity. It is inspired by the fluent Tai Chi movement, Cloud Hand. It develops with organic rotations and movements, like practicing Tai Chi on the canvas which makes the generative system alive.\n\nThat movement composes this piece, and once we feel the invisible vital life force by the physics of the algorithm, could we say it is a process of metaphysics?\n\nThis project uses p5js.\n\nPress [S] to download a high resolution jpeg.\nPress [A] to see the slow animation.\nPress [R] to download the animation.\nPress [B] to switch border/borderless mode.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0TzrEkgaCDQ8eXcUb99X5XtvMUGw8O4_IZHLIeDnS6xJhUwhWtvA_kiVBYC2iPYLW8eApwb_1C3HclDMGBhZck-nLNown0udQ-8"},

Pixel sorting is a procedure that isolates segments of pixels and sorts their positions based on any number of criteria (i.e. luminosity, hue, saturation). \n\nAssorted Positivity is a generative approach to making pixel sorting art without any photographic base. The algorithm uses several types of noise to generate an initial design, each one unique to the token and specifically conducive to pixel-sorting. The sorting displaces pixels in various directions based on their grayscale value; and hues determine how the sorting ends. Sometimes the sorting lends itself to a sort of drip look and other times it presents itself as depth and shading.\n\nThis project was initially influenced by my desire to sort past the ubiquitous negativity online and focus on the positivity, generosity, and genuine thoughtfulness that I have witnessed around this genart space--with collectors, artists, and people who simply appreciate the community.\n\nIntegrated into each piece is an uplifting adjective that is visible, yet blended into the art. At a glance, the viewer may not notice the steganographic message that is conveyed by an international visual method of telegraphing words. Each word is one that I imagine being used to describe people in the community, their actions, artists, and/or their work.\n\nEvery output brings me joy, and is a reminder to treat others with kindness and positivity.\n\nWatch as the pixels sort themselves out. \n\nRendering is best viewed in Chrome on a desktop with a high end GPU.\n\nA portion of the proceeds will go toward the international Make-A-Wish Foundation in the hopes of bringing some joy to critically ill children around the globe.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NWz-TBC0xdjk9y6KVnHnWQmSFnBRG3SqxPb7E0p0UpybIy6SaPu7rKXDCixtEEDKoHLi9KHB_B9oiR7R_ZLrgwbo19OUBz1obpE"},

Like the book's exploration of Venice, the pieces in \"Invisibles\" are rooted in the essence of Hong Kong, a city the creator called home for nine years.\n\nEach piece in this series captures the spirit of a different city, creating a beautiful and intricate mosaic of shapes, and patterns. The detailed engravings of architecture from the 18th and 19th centuries influenced its visual style while exploring the conceptual connection between engravings and code as a generation source.\n\nThis collection is plottable and aims to transcend the digital realm becoming tangible as an added dimension to the artwork beyond digital printing.

Each output contains a selection of geometric shapes that slide, twist, and resize over time. Their intersections divide the canvas into two regions, each with its own set of rules for generating mathematical textures. As predictable geometry and chaotic automata intersect and evolve, a variety of organic and artificial patterns emerge. Gradually, the colors and rules shift, and new forms appear. Through a series of carefully reflected changes, symmetry persists.\n\nEach animation is constructed from large virtual pixels. By varying their scale, spacing, and alignment a variety of patterns are generated — ranging from a pixel art aesthetic to one with softer, larger-scale structures. Where does a tiny pixel end, and the emergent whole it’s a part of begin?\n\nBuilding on the foundation laid in __*mono no aware*__ and __*Zoologic*__, __*Implications*__ continues the work of making the beautiful complexity of cellular automata visible and accessible. New techniques for optimization, color generation, and constraint selection -- along with simplifications to features and interactive controls -- place focus squarely on an endless and compelling animated experience.\n\n__*Implications*__ is a meditative work best experienced over the course of at least a few minutes.

What is a sketch when it’s not a conventional drawing? Whether they take the form of code, video, 3D models, immersive spaces, or multimodal explorations that don’t fit a neat categorization, these “sketches” are no less integral to the development of the respective artist’s body of work. Because of the relative novelty among audiences, the technical and conceptual merits of these process-oriented arts can be difficult to grasp, leaving underlying poetics invisible or misinterpreted. Worse still is the assumption that this work is tantamount to button-pushing, that machines are the true authors — trivializing the years spent developing a unique relationship with these materials.” — Jesse Damiani", "imageUrl": "/resources/images/collectionlogo.png"},

By referencing historical precedents, Flourish produces designs that exist between the past and present, striking a balance between tradition and innovation.\n\nFlourish’s logic uses a linguistic structure that treats simple shapes like an alphabet and arranges geometry into phrases, establishing and dissolving symmetries. This logic is similar to a formal grammar system with rules that describe how words can be combined to form sentences. As a very simple example, a rule for the English language might be that a noun phrase can be followed by a verb phrase. So, a person dances, a cat sleeps, a bird sings. In the context of Flourish, pentagons can be subdivided into triangles, which can be enclosed by circles to create complex patterns. As geometry is combined and rearranged, the linguistic-like structure of the image changes, which also changes the next possible sets of geometric operations.\n\nThe palettes reflect various eras and mediums, invoking the feeling of aged archival drawings, woodblock prints, freshly inked illustrations, blueprints, and photocopies. The images resemble photographs of drawings rather than the drawings themselves, creating the impression of a carefully archived collection of artifacts that document a history just now coming into existence.\n\nIn my own history, I spent many years filling notebooks with abstract flowing drawings using very fine pens while studying painting and drawing. I would start by making one small curved mark, and then make thousands more while following the natural rhythm that my hand and wrist made. The density of marks and careful variations of spacing gave the drawings a meditative quality. Flourish's fine flowing lines draw from this meditative practice, imbuing each image with a sense of careful attention and intention.\n\nThe best architecture is a harmony of the natural and the constructed. And so the fine detailed marks are meant to feel natural, and to build up the constructed geometries with an emergent natural foundation.\n\nManipulating the arrangement of primary shapes to create complex patterns is a hallmark of both generative design and traditional architectural design. Flourish exists somewhere between this relationship. Rather than taking the historical path of contemporary parametric architecture, with its large sweeping forms and sci-fi aesthetics, Flourish creates an alternative history, a revivalist rebirth of the roaring twenties for the 2020s.\n\n------\nPrints on archival paper will be made available at a later date.\n\nA percentage of profits from the primary sale will be donated to the Hawaii Community Foundation's Maui Strong Fund to support Maui residents affected by the wildfires.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/79a613560bd2b8f8976e0aa50ccfa150.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

On their journey, shapes cross over one another while occasionally encountering loops, beams, and numbered asteroids.\n \nFrom the earliest sketches, questions emerged: Where are they going? Who are they? Will their fall or race ever end? Where is the finish line? Or as Italo Calvino’s character Qfwfq, in the story The Form of Space, while falling, assuming he is falling, occasionally moving in an upward direction, maybe just flowing along an unknown path in the space without above and below, wonders if his trajectory will intersect with his love-longing in the future. On this never-ending fall, passing by one or many universes revolving around them, he contemplates all the positive and negative outcomes, dreaming of their parallels eventually meeting:\n\n“In this alternation of hopes and apprehensions, I continued to fall, constantly peering into the depths of space to see if anything heralded an immediate or future change in our condition. A couple of times I managed to glimpse a universe, but it was far away and seemed very tiny, well off to the right or to the left; I barely had time to make out a certain number of galaxies like shining little dots collected into superimposed masses which revolved with a faint buzz, when everything would vanish as it had appeared, upwards or to one side, so that I began to suspect it had only been a momentary glare in my eyes.\n\n […] unwound in continuous, parallel, straight lines which mean nothing beyond themselves in their constant flow, never meeting, just as we never meet in our constant fall […]”\n\nTo all on unknown latitudes, exploring forms of the space.\n\n-------------\nControls: \n\n[p] key or click/tap for pause/play animation\n\n[a] turn auto rotate on/off\n\n[n] rotate view clockwise\n\n\n-------------\nMade with p5.js and chroma.js. \n\n-------------\nMinting 3 tokens at a time will generate a series of Latitudes in all 3 possible directions in the same color palette. \n\n\n\n\n", "imageUrl": "https://arweave.net/ccG1ZTwT6OA07taSQVzFRZoPTr8XRPJRs68aX4T1NWE"},
