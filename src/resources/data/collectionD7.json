It is painting new patterns on the fly in between macro and micro compositions with a duality of different rhythms and continuous synchronicity. The focus is alternately drawn to detail, then distracted by movement elsewhere and caught up in the overall picture. This rhythm turns the visual complexity into an active experience.\n\nASDF: “My work should offer individual ways of interpretation, or even allow one to find some self in it. It wants to inspire some thoughts about dynamics and systemics and also just mesmerize the audience, capture them in a little fantasy, or just for a brief moment in a state of satisfaction.”\n\nCargo is the latest work in Kim Asendorf’s ongoing work series of pixel pattern animations. Starting with [monogrid](https://monogrid.xyz) in 2021, and [Sabotage](https://sabotage.kim) in 2022, both highly conceptual series, therefore visually very raw and unimaginable. Asendorf discovered various interesting details in these works, which eventually became fundamental in his artistic expression.\n\nCargo is a real time WebGL software written in JavaScript and GLSL. At its core is a flip-flop render buffer, also known as feedback buffer. That means the animation is alternately rendered in two different frame buffers. This technique allows the usage of the previous frame of the animation as an asset in the current rendering, which allows for a series of reactive animation strategies.\n\nAn initial image with variable structures and patterns is rendered and subsequently loaded into the frame buffer. A fragment shader is used to apply a set of animation algorithms that make the pixel move and a set of reset algorithms that constantly try to recreate the initial image. The final animation happens in selected containers and is always a combination of two algorithms, one from each set. By regularly animating and partially resetting the pixels, a wide range of movement patterns appear.\n\nCargo is a responsive and pixel exact artwork and it will fill the screen on any display size, thus changing the total amount of used pixels accordingly. This results in the fact that the detail level in the artwork is changing depending on the dimensions. The overall structure is consistently stretching the x and y axis independently. Single containers scale along the dimensions and offer more pixels to render the patterns at a larger representation compared to a smaller representation. This behavior leads to a brilliance, perfect pixels, a crisp rendering with nothing like compression artifacts.\n\nThis software includes the [simplex noise](https://github.com/jwagner/simplex-noise.js) JavaScript implementation by Jonas Wagner and the [cellular noise](https://github.com/stegu/webgl-noise) GLSL code by Stefan Gustavson.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YStoMZzvSrc9jrbZwj3d84GAiyqVTwsJLehjLTC_VP7RTs1Is6euMyF0KN8k-JDuJAxfLLf-95Klwi45sZjHnGTL--jtvQp3Il0"},

After a millennia of slumber it must again usher its minions into the expanse. It must sustain. It must replenish. So it guides its horde out to the stars, visiting countless worlds to restart the cycle. For an eternity the cycle has repeated, minding and tending this garden of worlds. Now it is time for the garden to give back. This event has come to be known as *The Harvest*.\n\n*The Harvest* depicts worlds that exist in eternal symbiosis with the Caretaker. We witness the spectacle of monumental chromatic beams as they impact the surface of these beautiful, alien bodies. The Caretaker assigns different constellations to each planet, giving rise to unique combinations of beams as they extract the much needed nectar. This project has been inspired by a life-long fascination for science fiction and space exploration. Aiming to capture a moment of awe, the beams reach to their origin, emulating a cathedral-like atmosphere in the vein of Hugh Ferriss, while borrowing inspiration from Micheal Whelan’s landscapes. All in the effort of capturing a sense of how small we are in relation to the cosmos.\n\n*The Harvest* is built on p5js, and takes advantage of its 3d api. With the orthogonal view enabled, the algorithm uses volumetric rectangular units to create the stylised illusion of alien landscapes. Each beam has a position, color, reach and yield that is calculated and procedurally drawn over time.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/e66607aa87a89005b573e509f8fa1ab0.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

Snowfro) has been intrigued by the idea of representing digital artwork in the physical world in the form of an ephemeral physical object with meaning, but with no inherent value. \n\nDonald Judd has long been an inspiration for Art Blocks. One aspect we admire most about Judd’s artistic practice is the elegance of design he effortlessly paired with the accessibility of materials that could be found at a hardware store. With Judd as inspiration, we hatched a plan to create a unique generative art friendship bracelet that includes instructions to make, in minutes, a simple bracelet using a few dollars’ worth of embroidery floss. Donald Judd believed that what surrounds us in our day-to-day life is already so beautiful, and that ultimately the experience of creating art is as important as owning it.\n\nErick was incredibly excited to collaborate with renowned artist Alexis André (a.k.a. MacTuitui) to bring generative art and ephemeral physical objects together in the form of friendship bracelets. Conceptualized by Erick and aesthetically and programmatically designed by Alexis, this project pairs creative coding with a beautiful spectrum of embroidery floss colors. The project was a true team effort, as each member of the Art Blocks team designed and named their own color palette!\n\nThe project is a token of our appreciation to the creators, makers, builders, and collectors who have all contributed to making the Art Blocks community what it is today. Participating in this project is a signal, both online and IRL, that you’re a participant in this evolution of art + community. You are pushing the best ideas forward. You are the reason all of these imaginative projects come to life. Our community is what makes all of this possible. So, to say it plainly, we appreciate you, and we hope that you’ll accept this bracelet as a token of our special friendship!\n\nThe owner of any wallet with an Art Blocks piece at the time of snapshot (October 26, 2022, at 3pm US Central time) is eligible to claim two mints from this special generative art project. We would love to see you keep one bracelet and share your love for generative art by gifting your second mint! These mints are free to claim (you pay only the gas) and exist on L1 Ethereum. Please note that we may in the future release additional modified iterations of the Friendship Bracelets project, ideally on an L2 scaling solution, that may substantially increase the total supply of tokens related to the project, with the intent of being a more accessible entry point to a larger audience. But this version is what we're here to celebrate today, and this gift is for you in gratitude for your support along the way. Please enjoy this token of our friendship and explore the wonderful artwork created by Alexis André. Then, let's all make bracelets together! \n\nWarmly,\nAlexis + Erick + the Art Blocks team\n\n\n\nThe claim window expires on January 10, 2023, at noon US Central time.\n\nClick into the Display Notes for information about making your bracelet.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/P3oEmfNNRGQgkLA1z3ya7NBdjlw_BXuStDPEoEzGiCcqykQlDh5wJgzOet2DE88cv8hNUTgA33DwO54O7mni1No_5alxHqY84-vy"},

Pictograms and hieroglyphics turned into paintings, which eventually became moving images and photoreal graphics. Spoken words evolved into written text, eventually becoming complex screenplays, computer code, and a world of hyperlinks. Most mediums are not discarded, but combined or extended to incorporate new technology or ideas. \n\nWhen a new medium comes into existence, the capabilities of both the artist and viewer increase. The potential subjects within said medium can grow in complexity as well, some fully dependent on the medium that holds them. Other subjects are timeless, popping in and out of multiple movements and genres throughout history. An example of the latter is still life. From ancient carvings through contemporary art, scenes of commonality, beauty, and metaphor have persisted. Traditionally viewed as a type of technical practice or meditation (the bottom of the “hierarchy of genres”), some examples of still life have gone on to be among the most important works in art history. \n\nChimera is a natural progression of still life. It is an old tradition in the very new medium of on-chain generative art, a movement that will have an enormous presence in the future. Chimera simultaneously reaches into the past while exploiting the capabilities of the present and seeks to represent a unique moment in time, a generation of art in between digital and physical realities, encapsulating where we came from and where we are going. \n\nNOTES:\n\nChimera is graphically intensive. Modern hardware is recommended. Ensure that your browser has hardware acceleration enabled.\n\nThe charitable portion of this release will be donated to various cancer research efforts.\n\nCONTROLS:\n\n“A”: Toggle animations\n“R”: Toggle autorotation\n“C”: Capture screenshot\n“H”: Capture HD screenshot (CPU intensive) \n\n—\n\nThank you to all that participate in, share, or otherwise support this release.

The visual language is reminiscent of hand-draughted technical drawing, a precise and methodical practice that progresses at a radically different pace to the flowing and capricious movement of water. To increase this tension between dynamic motion and static mechanical process I wanted the surface textures to appear worn and aged like a drawing that has spent its life in the bottom of a mechanics drawer. This process of abrasion and discoloration is occurring on yet another scale of time adding complexity to the references of time passing. \n\nWoven into the very fabric of Fontana is a fully generative solution for creating color expression. This means there is no reliance on preset palettes with every output being an entirely unique color articulation of the color story I want the project to reveal as a whole. Far from being random I attempted to create an approach which produces colors that evoke early 20th Century art and design media.

From screen printing techniques, first developed in China around 1000AD and later popularized in western art culture by e.g. Andy Warhol, to the screens on our devices used to consume both digital art as well as most traditional art we experience in our life.\n\nThe \"Screens\" series is a celebration of modern art. It is inspired by the aesthetics inherent in screen printing along with the compositions and colors of both Bauhaus, Constructivism, and pulp fiction sci-fi covers.\n\nThe compositions in \"Screens\" is based purely on strict geometries and plays with the tension, and symphonies that can be created from combining simple rules. The end result can range from chaotic non-figurative to strongly ordered isometric scenes.\n\nThe generative system underlying the rendering mimics the screen printing process by rendering and applying a single color at a time to a master image. Each virtual screen may be more or less aligned with the master, creating a lovely flawed balance to the precision of the rendered geometry.\n\n25% of the proceeds from this project will be donated to Den Blå Planet, The Danish National Aquarium, in support of their work on preserving and restoring marine life and ecology.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/n2xsI88RBBV8vxkQVvBlfO_4EVey3097-pgK29Oid-Id7aOGZrwE1qvi6eZBjiwrSfYEFTEsjvr_OXwDOkeBc_f_4EhnRFUVKg"},

No compression, no Netscape, no social media, no NFTs. The JPEG compression has specifically enabled photography-based imagery on the net. It has always served that purpose and over time become the de facto default for showing high quality imagery online. But compression always leaves a trace, which has become the lens through which the network sees the world of uploaded images.\n\n\"A painting is not a picture of an experience, but is the experience.\" ― Mark Rothko\n\nJPEG tries to create an image programatically fully expressing that signature compression. An image that is like empty made from barely nothing, yet fully present in its blazing appearance. A work deeply material, expressing itself through the language of code and codec only. This is not a JPEG depicting an image. The JPEG is the image itself.\n\nDelving into the depths and peculiarities of the digital, tethered to art history, JPEG found its way to the surface. Generated color fields are utilised to trigger the compressing algorithm, resulting in a world of raw visual entities. Where the abstract expressionists cut out the depiction in painting, aiming to let the artist convey pure emotion, JPEG cuts out the artist's emotion and lets it emerge from within the algorithm. Carefully you could categorize the work as *compressionism*. An art form where the machine speaks in its own raw language, but nevertheless makes a direct touch to our human heart.\n\nJPEG is a collection of generative images in the JPEG file format. The work tries to break with the idea of the fixed file format, therefor creating the JPEG entirely from code using no image material whatsoever. The individual JPEGs are generated responsively at the moment of viewing based on the token hash as a random seed. You can literally drag the JPEG out from the browser window.\n\nJPEG pays tribute to interface culture, and as such the work is responsive and not scaling. When the work is resized, the work is again rendered and compressed. When viewed smaller, details will disappear, yet the composition stays recognisable. It’s like stepping back to see a work from further away. The choice of color wanders from monochromatic tones to the brutality of complete randomness and everything in between.\n\nIn honour of the blockchain and the web, the work is written in vanilla JavaScript, using no dependancies, and generates a standard JPEG. This way the file is downloadable, aiming for a materiality that comes as close as possible to the standard browser.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kFuNX4IUaGGwtl4ldvxLk0XY0NptN3FIFMriOvcfbHEJA44j9njtjJcvWqqAWEW9HloNWgZQNMt2Wvb-RANMD_cCpjYHH4AAWuw"},

The work is informed by notions of choreography, modular pattern composition and character design.\n\nKubikino is an idiosyncratic face, made of a combination of graphical elements and colours generated by code. Using an essential library of geometries - all deriving from the circle - and primary tones, the code randomly creates new faces resembling human physiognomy, animals and traditional masks.\n\nThrough the deliberate reference to a face, Kubikino prompts contemplation on the traditional notions of identity, similarity, and persona, as well as the ongoing need to establish one's own representation within a community - from traditional masks to digital avatars. For centuries, human identity has been a source of cultural fascination, with the word \"identity\" stemming from the Latin term \"identitas,\" signifying both \"sameness\" and “oneness.”\n\nInspired by Bruno Munari's \"Faces,\" a collection of abstract portraits created using basic geometric shapes and lines, Kubikino reflects on the simplicity, playfulness, and power of design to communicate across cultures and generations.\n\nDrawing upon the influential dance theories of Rudolf Laban and Merce Cunningham, Kubikino's device process for the creation of its faces is underpinned by a sophisticated framework of modular pattern composition. The project's generated output is organised into a grid-based structure, where each section corresponds to a phrase, and the relationship between the various sections collectively generates the final composition. Referencing Laban’s Movement Analysis, each section is paraphrasing LMA's four key components: body (loop), shape (direction), dynamic (colour), space (relationship within the space).\n\nKubikino also adopts the principles of \"chance\" and \"structured improvisation\" articulated by avant-garde pioneers John Cage and Merce Cunningham in the 1960s. The Kubikino identity is constructed from a selected array of animated graphics, rules, and paradigms that correspond to motifs, scores, and ensembles found in conventional art forms such as dance, music, and paintings.", "imageUrl": "https://media-proxy.artblocks.io/0x99a9b7c1116f9ceeb1652de04d5969cce509b069/464000000.png"},

Each flag is sited in a fictitious future desert generated uniquely using code-based frequencies, shapes, colours, and skies. These data worlds are spatial and solar—viewers can look around the scene by dragging in its window. Dawn breaks and night falls accurately for the locale that each flag represents across day and year.\n\nWorld Flag imagines a shared but bleak and deeply inequitable future in which ongoing governmental and legislative failures alongside environmental degradation and mismanagement have rendered the state as a ghost, as an apparition of itself. The national flag is reimagined as a performed militaristic sign for a doomed place-based political order.\n\nAll 195 World Flags in the series are generated from one 112 KB script stored on-chain. This script uses the WebGL (web graphics language) protocol, a new medium which allows complex visual data worlds to be rendered directly in the web browser. When distributed using the blockchain mechanism and viewed on mobile electronic devices, the work and medium propose a global public art experience—post place, post geography. \n\nThese are spatial worlds - drag on the scene to look around. Press F on a keyboard for full screen, R to slowly rotate the camera. M to hide the mouse pointer. On a phone or touch screen tip the top of world to go full screen. Tip bottom of world to rotate camera.  Tip top again to leave full screen. Tip bottom again to leave rotation. \n\nFurther Notes\nThe ClimateWatch 2019 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions index for the 195 member countries of the UN is a key conceptual underpinning of World Flag. The artworks from the project will be released in a predetermined order based on the 195 countries’ respective GHG emissions, from highest to lowest, irrespective of population size.\n\nGerrard will also produce a single Artist Proof (A/P) World Flag NFT—a composite of all 195 countries represented in the project that will be reserved for institutional acquisition, and it will be minted upon donation.\n\nJohn Gerrard will dedicate 10 percent of artist’s proceeds from World Flag sales to Hometree, a nonprofit organization that works to address Ireland’s declining biodiversity and the global climate crisis. Through its Wild Atlantic Rainforest Project, Hometree is restoring a temperate rainforest in Ireland, a unique ecosystem.\n\nIn 2021, Gerrard became the first artist within Pace Gallery's program to release an NFT with Western Flag (NFT), an artwork derived from his simulation Western Flag (Spindletop, Texas) 2017, which was commissioned for Earth Day 2017 by Channel 4 in the UK. Western Flag (NFT) recently became the first NFT to be acquired by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\n\nGerrard’s Petro National generative NFT series, released in 2022, was the first Web3 project to be produced as part of the multifaceted collaboration between Art Blocks and Pace Verso. In 2023, Petro National #16 (Nigeria) was acquired by the Centre Pompidou in Paris.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hxzm7idUwR5D3ozOcEOAz1fLvrKtqKW2DcLDMuM0xiPPE6j8afn6DCeeGi7sAE81Mt2k9Tgq6X_pUOmE-DYQBS-kI0mBW1w53rXD"},

It's a constant process of discovery. Eventually, I'll find a result that feels right — but only once it's staring back at me.\n\nThe name of this piece is a tongue-in-cheek nod to Orson Scott Card’s 1985 science fiction novel, *Ender’s Game*, as well as to the countless outputs I’ve produced during this creative process.

By considering the relationship between sound frequencies rather than musical notes, the piece explores the possibilities of harmony without the constraints of an instrument. \n\nUtilizing specific intervals which the human ear perceives as balanced, the algorithm creates a chord by computing a set of frequencies which are multiples or subdivisions of the interval. Combining this algorithm with the hash, Ratio produces a unique chord for each mint, with varying levels of tension, brightness, and microtonal deviation. \n\nThe sound field washes up against visuals which evoke streams of light falling across a series of panes. Sound data slowly illuminates and transforms the panes over time, creating a meditative respite for viewers. \n\nA full length fx(text) article about the theory behind Ratio is available here: https://bit.ly/ratio-theory\n\n\n~ Interaction ~\n\n- Press “f” to toggle fullscreen mode\n- Press “r” to record a 30-second video clip with audio. Use Safari for highest quality video and mp4 format. Chrome is next best but can only output the webm format (which you can then convert to mp4 via an online tool such as https://www.freeconvert.com/webm-to-mp4)\n- Press “1” to toggle between the generated chord and the closest possible match on a piano\n\n\n~ Aspect Ratio ~\n\nOutputs will automatically switch between landscape 16:9 or portrait 9:16 based on the size of your window. If you’d like to enforce a specific aspect ratio, you can append the parameter “?aspect=[number]” to an output’s URL. For instance, “[output_url]?aspect=1” will enforce a square aspect ratio regardless of the window size and fullscreen mode.\n\n\n~ About Night Sea ~\n\nRatio is the second generative audiovisual project by Night Sea, following their first release, l.o, on Art Blocks in September of 2023. Their other work includes Sonatina for Plotter and Laptop, presented at Art Blocks Marfa in 2023, a project exploring the sonic possibilities of a pen plotter. Their work as a music duo has been released on the labels Silent Season and Huinali, and they have performed at music festivals like Mutek SF and Chillits.", "imageUrl": "https://ipfs.raribleuserdata.com/ipfs/QmSiETUEzXKxhms2mv7je7Ts2XZ6yt2vW2pn92s8TU5qXE"},

The idea is simple. You start with a string of nodes connected to one another to form a shape. Each node feels 3 forces:\n - A repulsion force from all other nodes\n - An attraction force towards its immediate neighbors\n - An attraction force towards the midpoint between its neighbors\n\nAs you add more nodes into the shape, these 3 rules cause the shape to curve into itself, growing into a complex form of layered undulating lines. The goal is to create a shape that fills as much space as possible while maintaining a rigid form and avoiding overlapping itself. By focusing specifically on where and when you add more nodes, and how you interpret those nodes into a shape, there is much variety to be found in this simple algorithm.\n\nSince I first learned about this technique, and wrote my own version based off these rules, I have been continuing to iterate, evolve, and optimize my code. It's an algorithm I always find myself coming back to, and has become my most researched topic and longest running experiment. I love its use of real life physics, and I find its outputs aesthetically pleasing on a deeper, almost instinctual level. \n\nEach output of 'Spaghetti Bones' starts with a simple shape as a seed for the differential growth algorithm. Throughout the rendering process, the shape is fed more nodes, and grows until it cannot find any empty space to fill. As it grows, a form is interpreted from the nodes of the growth and drawn onto the screen, creating a snapshot of the growth at that particular moment. There are many rules that govern how the shape grows, and how its form is interpreted, and these rules often evolve throughout the rendering process. When the render is complete, the resulting image is a full catalog of the history of the shape's life. \n\nThe name of this project was created by Nicole, my girlfriend and an art wizard. Early on in the development of this project, I asked her to name an output I was sharing, and she chose to call it ‘Spaghetti Bones’ because that’s what it looked like. Since then, the name has stuck with me. I decided to keep the name for the final project in order to highlight the playfulness of each output, to encourage imagination when viewing this abstract art, and to thank Nicole for being tremendously supportive and helpful throughout my exploration of the art world.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VPGV-LNUhYXZZmCDlXnVHcpAT4LqvBRM8nnYzMeiWIl89WY7s6kaVOfQ2Yx5RvLXKMCLLgEOgMAviWLOjG49BVGR_E-BCxVepchE"},

Approach any problem from a position of complete ignorance and try to find the simplest way to solve it.\n2. Make the most with as little as possible and avoid introducing complexity unless absolutely necessary.\n3. Accept that intuition often falls short in predicting the best way forward (*especially* when creating generative art), and entertain any idea that presents itself.\n\nStaying mostly within the confines set by these rules, the development of Gumbo ended up taking me on many unexpected journeys.\n\nAt its core, Gumbo explores the diversity of form that can be achieved by combining simple shapes, such as spheres, donuts, boxes, and cylinders. Despite the basic components, the final arrangements are strangely familiar, some reminiscent of space stations, others of internal organs. By painting these structural canvases in an indiscriminate fashion, an intricate interplay between colour and form arises, emphasizing the spatial nature that underlies both. Texture, a subject I deeply appreciate, stars as the main character of Gumbo, celebrated both as a reference to the material world, and, especially, as something with uniquely digital characteristics. Present throughout the project, it is primarily used to illuminate the structures and add life to otherwise flat blocks of colour.\n\nWhile working on Gumbo, I've found inspiration from a diverse set of sources, ranging from the vibrant and captivating colours of Cold War-era propaganda posters and Japanese ukiyo-e to the texture-heavy work of artists like Virgil Finlay and Bruce Conner. In addition, Gumbo utilises a rendering approach that can be described as a digital equivalent of physical methods like silkscreen and woodblock printing, a connection that was not recognised until the project's later stages.\n\n**Note**: Gumbo requires WebGL2 and is computationally expensive to render. Older devices will probably struggle!\nTo save a high-resolution render, press \"p\" while in live mode and enter the desired size (or add \"?resolution=your-size-here\" to the end of the URL).

I've often wondered where a machine's mind and \"hand\" would wander given the same opportunity.\n\nThis project explores the age-old computer art phenomenon of inviting the viewer to actively participate in the interpretation of the visual output. The way \"Sharp-E\" draws the strokes is through a mix of various movements — irregular curves, straight lines, sudden changes in direction — in a classic random walk algorithm, while avoiding overlaps with previously drawn strokes. There are no pre-programmed forms per se, but nevertheless it can be common for the viewer to perceive images, symbols, meaning in the generated output.\n\nSo where does your mind wander? What forms, symbols, and meaning do you see?\n\nControls:\n• 'D' toggles pausing/drawing or continues space-filling after the first stop (if available)\n• 'R' reassembles the piece (This automatically happens every minute)\n• 'S' saves the output", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Bdbst7e0bHRVnAJuKRRaG9m16vO_A122Fly97aktdBv9CGlWY8kY2zKlH7wngg3snRdffc5QcSDdZaBUi-7ekuHOY4YasGrLYg"},

Yet we fail to fully comprehend this in our daily errands. Entretiempos is an artwork that reflects on this, based on an aesthetic that pays a tribute to the works of Sonia Delaunay, František Kupka and other painters from their era, recreated by the usage of intersecting rings that create a varied and rich space.\n\nThe work plays with the time scales by painting dynamically and letting the viewer pause the work, restart, set it to loop indefinitely, painting and vanishing in an endless cycle. And it can be set to be done at varying speeds, to appreciate what happens in between the time scales (\"entre tiempos\", in Spanish).\n\nAlso, there is a broader theme that I find of interest to explore from every work that I engage with. It has to do with the concept of what I call total cognitive space, or the total range of possibilities that can be expressed / achieved with a given scenario and set of conditions. In this case, I was interested in expanding my rendition of the works of Delaunay into a broader space. How does this approach scale with varying parameter ranges? Is the painting still interesting? Can it express something new? Connected to this, I am also interested in thinking about what emotions would mean for an artificial sentient being. We talk about artificial intelligence, but leave aside artificial emotions all too often. While artificial intelligences are indeed interesting, we fail to recognize the paramount importance of emotions in human behaviour. To this end, this work explores also the result of painting with machine-like precision vs. performing the artwork with a range of possible imprecisions. The perfection of the machine vs. the imperfection of the human, does it trigger different emotions in us humans? What will the reaction of a machine be whenever they develop a taste?\n\nThis work exposes features that deal with its time and space scales, background colour, background elements, the palettes used, certain colour accents that may happen (golden accents, b&w tones), the style used to draw the geometric shapes (fill, lines, outline), the degree of paint precision and other features that influence the final result. The user may download a PNG file at any arbitrary resolution at any step of the paint process using the commands provided for that. A brief list of commands is as follows. Please note that you need to click on the artwork first to make sure it will receive the typed commands:\n\np to pause/resume the work\nr followed by y to enter the looping mode\nd followed by +/- or any number from 1 to 9 to increase resolution\ns followed by c to save current image\ns+f to automatically save the final image when the system finishes painting\ns+m to restart and save a sequence of images of the process\nr+0 (zero) to reset all parameters and resolutions and restart\nk at any time to define keyframes, then r+0 to restart the work and it will automatically pause at defined steps, or s+i and the work will restart and automatically save an image at every keyframe defined with k. Reload browser to reset.\n\nThere is an Easter egg hidden in every work.\n\nFor the full project description, inspiration and rationale, as well as the full list of features and controls plus a hint at the Easter Egg, please visit the project homepage at https://www.iillucid.com/entretiempos", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_7oB6tc8f3h0CuIoC1NihQSASyHwTdGyuRdB6oquKh8kUVIzSJ3LsPOD-h8-APin2pBaInSzlbvfCucw95TvH1zcjfpywNIaSLU"},

Witnessing the vast fields of yuccas flowering simultaneously and watching the sunrise over Judd's 100 untitled works in mill aluminum are two specific moments that will never leave my memory. Combining these two sensations resulted in generative arrangements of yuccas and boxes.\n## Edge of the desert\nThe city of Marfa is on the northeast side of the Chihuahuan desert. The weather is dry and hot in the summer. Plants that grow naturally in the region, like the yucca, have adapted well to the harsh conditions.\n## Soaptrees\nIn the Americas, there are a lot of different types of yucca. The type of yucca that grows in and around Marfa is called yucca elata, which is also known as the soaptree yucca. These yuccas grow very slowly, only about an inch per year. Yucca elata doesn't always bloom, but when it does, the flowers come out between May and June.\n## Sunrise at Chinati\nThe Chinati Foundation is a museum in Marfa based on Donald Judd's ideas. The focus is on works that have a strong connection to the land around them. Sometimes a special event called \"Sunrise at Chinati\" is held at the museum so that people can see the many works in the golden light of the morning sun.\n# An SVG is available!\nThe SVG is a fully scalable resolution agnostic version of the image.

I saved my favorite picture files and small free software files to floppy disks with a capacity of roughly 1 megabyte and stored them carefully. Those floppy disks were my treasure. Later, when the disks deteriorated and became unreadable or were lost, the data became memories with a deep feeling of loss.\n\nBlockchains have arisen. Are these truly persistent?\n\nAfter all, digital data are also a type of memories. They are stored in a person's mind, deteriorate, and one day will be lost with that person.\n\nI find the fragility and beauty in them.\n　\n\n\n\n\n\n　\nIn this work, I attempted to represent a fictional collapsed blockchain world with visuals and sound.\n　\nThe chain has already been abandoned, and the few nodes that remain barely alive are just maintaining their appearances. Visualizing the remnants of blocks that no longer serve their original purpose, they form something like a submerged city. Then, a large amount of data that has lost its connection to the blocks and has deteriorated to the point that it can no longer be opened, flutters through the sky. The countless remnants of data form a cloud, which undulates like a wave. The details of the data cannot be confirmed, however, they can be seen as glittering lights. As I try to recall the contents of the data that can no longer be opened, I am filled with vague memories and a sense of nostalgia.\n\nThis work started with generating sound by code. The sound of rippling waves can be heard by clicking on the screen. Since it would be impractical to store huge sound data on the blockchain, the sound was formed from white noise. In order to reproduce the sound of rippling waves, it was necessary to deepen my understanding of the structure of the sound by referring to academic papers. Then the sound was completed, and the visual imagination expanded from there.\n\nI like to visit the sea near my home and in other places. Different seascapes can be seen from different locations and angles. When I am there, idly gazing at the seascape and listening to the sound of the waves, I sometimes feel as if I am the only human there and the world has gone to ruin. If the world were ruined, this seascape and the sound of the waves would remain for a long time. This feeling and the fragility felt in digital data are the basis of this work. I imagine that the heaven or the graveyard where the lost data flies up in the sky and arrives may be a seascape like this.\n\nThe reason why I used data as lights and clouds drifting in the sky and moved them like waves is because I wanted to depict unrealistic behavior with a realistic subject matter and to express a beautiful and bizarre world in which these intertwine.\n\nFor the visual expression technique, I further pursued and evolved the drawing system that I have developed in \"GHOST IN THE CODE\" and my other works. Everything is composed of rectangles, indicating that this world is beginning to become low-resolution. Depth is linked to the size of the rectangles, and distant objects are represented by small rectangles as if they were in focus. Dispersion in the position and color of the rectangles indicate the degree of deterioration of the world. Moreover, the sky, blocks, and the surface of the water are identified and each has its own characteristics.\n\nAlgorithms generate various compositions, colors, and other features. I have attempted to make each output feel nostalgic and fresh at the same time. The blocks, which have lost their original meaning, are contrasted with the data, which exists in isolation from them, in stillness and movement. Occasional red clouds or blocks mean that they are corrected as red, the first color, due to missing information.\n\nThrough these integrations, I have attempted to create a work that can be stored on a blockchain, and that is both visually and sonically interactive.\n\n[NOTE]\n\n-To save the image press the 'S' key.\n-To change the flow velocity press the '↑' or '↓' key.\n\nModern hardware and browser hardware acceleration is recommended. The Chrome browser on a desktop with a high-end GPU is optimal.

As the grandson of two artists who worked in the mediums of printmaking, paper cutting, and quilt making, I strive to incorporate the qualities of these mediums into my stipple-based digital paintings.\n\nAdditional approaches are pulled from my abstract experimentation in \"Dot Matrix Gradient Study\" with distortion and \"digital misprinting\" applied to the stipple matrices, but with a return to a figurative form.\n\nPalettes used in \"Sonoran Roadways\" are largely inspired by Arizona's scenic drives and fantastical multi-colored sunsets – peaceful and familiar to me. \n\n\"Sonoran Roadways\" is a call to appreciate the potentially mundane, and get lost in the imagination of the journey back to somewhere called home or the fantasy of an exploration to somewhere new.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Isj-RJyheJVO2Uw0NppmdwoPUFY2KrqiqZaKyI4lZFoRCJs4lKjWqItrPLt5IWIbsrNjWx508Q4Y1nuhy3Jw0wWIeGtUHQ3fdk"},

Whether encapsulated in physical or computational techniques, these processes act with their own degree of autonomy from our own biases and as a result, open up new ideas and sensibilities while dismantling traditional notions of authorship. They allow one to code the possibility of discovery and surprise into the creative process in a manner that can be widely shared and because of this transmissibility, algorithms frustrate the idea of a single author, inviting speculation on the shared nature of creativity. For this reason we have always understood our work to be a collaboration between each other, those who share with us and those who inspire us. \n\nOver the years, the studio has indulged in a number of obsessions. One is the conviction that history is a generative source with which to constantly entangle. Whether it is through stories, characters, techniques, or events, history acts as a medium active with properties that constantly reshape and transform our concept of the present. We look back to move forward, like hitching a ride. It is here that we encounter Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528) and his masterpiece Melancholia I (1514) to inspire a deep dive into the process of engraving as a representational technique reinterpreted through the contemporary medium of code. By scratching metal away from a plate, an inversion of conventional drawing, engraving allowed a work of art to be reproduced and disseminated widely. In addition to the piece’s masterful delineation, its allegory resonates with us as well. In Dürer’s time melancholy was associated with insanity but also with creativity. In the engraving, the winged personification of melancholy -- the work is widely regarded to be a self-portrait of the artist -- is surrounded by the tools and elements of geometry. For Dürer, as for a handful of others who came before and after, who test the porous borders between art, science and religion, geometry is a vehicle for imagination, a shadow of the divine and a portal to the infinite. \n\nThis work Primitives is a kindred meditation on infinity through an exploration of a novel geometric structure using algorithm and code, the tools of today's geometers and mystics, made visible through the anachronism of the engravers trade translated into pure 1’s and 0’s. Primitives grows through a single shape that can repeat and scale in specific ways that are never random, but rather tightly governed by geometric logics. It is about drawing infinity through a radical modularity; ordered but aperiodic. Unlike a regular crystal, whose molecular pattern is periodic (or repetitive in all directions), the distinctive quality of this quasicrystal is that its structural pattern never repeats the same way twice. Endless and uneven in aggregate, Primitive clusters can be described by the precise arrangement of a single modular part. As these small units aggregate together they form larger figures that themselves combine into ever larger movements, always a little bit different from any other. In this sense, quasicrystalline patterns have an infinite capacity to create and carry information. \n\nWe are here because this is a medium for sharing in perpetuity. In the last couple of years, on the cusp of our third decade of practice, we have watched with awe and delight a renaissance in generative work as it's adopted by an entirely new generation around blockchain technologies. This inspired us to enter this new space with our own enduring questions of form and geometry, modularity and variability, historical continuity, and the thirst for endlessness. Primitives is what we selected as our primer into generative art on-chain because both the work and the medium grapple with these questions. \n\nSome Notes:\nOn the screen, Primitives is represented as a two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional figure. Each invocation comes with a sequence of projections, or rotations, around this object. As Primitives spins, there are moments when its blocks snap into alignment with other blocks  revealing its underlying lattice and crystalline nature. Each projection can be saved as a high resolution image for printing. Primitives can also be saved in three dimensions as an .obj file for a variety of uses including the creation of a physical object through 3-d printing or fabrication. Below is a list of interface instructions:\n\n'left' + 'right' arrow keys to rotate \n'up' + 'down' arrow keys to zoom in \n'g' regrows geometry \n'i' saves image \n'o' saves .obj\n\nThank you,\nAranda\\Lasch\n2022", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hW62_RI-H8gkj1M1BT0i3QcHbFhubEXLCaZJVophFXOy5HHjbpHEW8zCDh81vlGGpHVDkpzYZncWePucXyyBatxlj7CI8IVmZj4"},

Each year, trees add a new ring to their trunks, recording their growth and responding to the changing seasons and environmental conditions. These rings tell a story of the tree's life. By replicating these patterns, the project captures the rhythmic and organic qualities of nature.\n\nIn this project, I wanted to explore the aesthetic and conceptual possibilities of tree rings through code-based art. I used a generative algorithm to simulate the growth of virtual trees, generating patterns that resemble the annual rings of real trees, but with a twist. Instead of using traditional circular or oval shapes, I experimented with different geometric forms and noise. I also played with colors and instead of using earthy and realistic colours, the palettes are inspired by the richness and diversity of the natural world.\n\nThe algorithm works by starting with the outer most ring, which over time grows towards an arbitrary chose center according to certain rules and parameters. Each iteration adds a new layer of shapes inside the previous one, mimicking the accumulation of tree rings. I introduced random mutations and variations, which introduce unexpected and unpredictable outputs, evoking the unpredictability of natural processes.\n\nEach artwork is inviting the viewer to contemplate the complexity and diversity of nature. I hope that this project will inspire others to explore the wonders of nature and to experiment with code-based art as a means of expression and exploration.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/62be5f1e594a61d0fbc7414d425b16a2.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

There is a purpose for us to be together. It influences our behavior, identities, and choices. The diversity of shapes, colors, and combinations in this work is the metaphor for how we are connected and how these connections influence a complex web, which is represented here in this form that resembles a beehive. Bees have an enormous sense of community, a behavior essential for their survival. In this work, a single feature can radically alter the perception of form as a whole. The work contains eight possible shapes: random, stars, hexagons, triangles, arrows, trapezoids, diamonds, and flags. These shapes can be arranged following a random flow, rotating, or pointing to the center. Moreover, they can vary in size, spacing, and color. The color palettes correspond to edition groups. As a generative artwork, beauty arises from a mixture of all diversity.

I started a slow introspection on the subject, and at the end of the year, I released “Foundations”, a series that focuses on the origins of our identity.\n\n“Tout tracé” is the second act, and its direct continuity. \nIn French, it means *“All mapped out”*, referring to the idea of an all planned future or *“a ready made path”.*\n\nThis series is the counterpoint of this vision. \n\nLife is full of surprises, good or bad, and each moment will have an impact on us, creating our set of experiences, many of them involuntary and embedded in our existence.\nAs humans, we are in constant evolution and therefore, on a quest of identity; of who we really are.\nWe are surrounded by expectations : from society, culture, religion, parents, friends, family… A list of rules that need to be followed and lived by; but, at the end of the day, I believe that only our choices matter.\n\nLike “Foundations”, the composition of “Tout tracé” is grid based: full of boxes expected to be filled.\nBut this series is about growth, evolution, expression and re-definition. It’s about fighting against the structure in place, finding our own voice and re-shaping our reality.\nIt is finding its uniqueness and identity that will be revealed through the millions of lines drawing each artwork, technically signing the idea of “Tout tracé”, that comes with a double meaning: *“All drawn”*.\n\n\n--\n- **Press ‘S’** to export a still image.\n- **Press ‘H’** to open a new tab of the artwork in HD (A3 format).\n\n-- \n\nOpening one output in fullscreen or in live view will run an animation revealing the artwork.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LGePFIF9DcSYNE5dSM2wnxL5DFBCHbJgUenWKVtubRYM9NdpIp6bC77KYFWGcz-77nZQiezIU4J3JDAuh4PiVtrwLdc6H9G77lE"},

Empiricism describes the world, while rationalism explains it. This conflict has been at the core of me throughout my studies, and I explore the idea further in this project.\n\nDipolar tries to answer the question \"What would electromagnetism look like in two dimensions?\", itself rich in the ideas of rationalism. To an empiricist, it is a question which can not be answered, but the answer has impacts throughout physics, from 3D electromagnetism to condensed matter. These questions and those like them have been grappled with for thousands of years, and we will die without knowing if our attempts at answers will be seen any differently from Plato's theory of Forms.\n\nOur three-dimensional universe constrains by its symmetry the behaviour of point charges to the radial fields that we are used to. In two dimensions the fields can curl around the charge, leading to two kinds of fields able to be produced by a charge. When paired with another particle of the same type and equal but opposite charge they create a 'dipole moment', which look alike when composed of either type of charge. Dipolar shows the field profiles produced by these combinations for each type, and as an idealised 'point dipole'.\n\nThe style was inspired by the sketches of Euler and da Vinci. Both were revolutionary minds, they sought to understand and explain the world in diagram, a tradition that has been preserved in art and science to this day. More broadly, I've felt inspired by Sol Lewitt and Vera Molnar, in particular their use of dense detail, seeing how it can provide tension in their work and draw the viewer in closer.\n\n*An SVG for plotting can be downloaded by pressing DOWN*\n*A 4096x4096 image can be downloaded by pressing UP*\n*Plotting speed can be adjusted with LEFT/RIGHT*\n*The animation can be restarted with SPACE*", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NteiZgET7b7vFP9e77QAcbu3AAD2X5J8GqwvTh7zzWkxYhklSAw_a25iCQ51esedRlpSRRL758d7WjT3Hje7_apB9uYE7lOcrg"},

Each output contains a selection of geometric shapes that slide, twist, and resize over time. Their intersections divide the canvas into two regions, each with its own set of rules for generating mathematical textures. As predictable geometry and chaotic automata intersect and evolve, a variety of organic and artificial patterns emerge. Gradually, the colors and rules shift, and new forms appear. Through a series of carefully reflected changes, symmetry persists.\n\nEach animation is constructed from large virtual pixels. By varying their scale, spacing, and alignment a variety of patterns are generated — ranging from a pixel art aesthetic to one with softer, larger-scale structures. Where does a tiny pixel end, and the emergent whole it’s a part of begin?\n\nBuilding on the foundation laid in __*mono no aware*__ and __*Zoologic*__, __*Implications*__ continues the work of making the beautiful complexity of cellular automata visible and accessible. New techniques for optimization, color generation, and constraint selection -- along with simplifications to features and interactive controls -- place focus squarely on an endless and compelling animated experience.\n\n__*Implications*__ is a meditative work best experienced over the course of at least a few minutes. Put on some music, full-screen the live view, and enjoy the show! What sorts of symmetry do you see? What sorts of shapes and textures are there, and how do they move?

This sense of structure is something that holds true to most of us individuals, communities, nations. However disorganised or frail one may be on the inside one often makes a substantial effort to appear structured, ordered. In other words our orderliness stems from the perception of that very orderliness.\n\nThe themes explored in my work are often a bi-product of my echoic memory in which I often pick up on background movie dialogues and tend to remember them by associating a colour and feeling to them. This in turn becomes an artistic direction, drawing inspiration from the sets, colours, location, time period, soundtrack, language and so on. The soundbite and evoked emotions guide the exploration and creation process.\nMore often than not the line from the movie becomes the title for the piece, as is the case for _Such A Lovely Time_.\n\n_Such A Lovely Time_ has a number of simple traits that when combined create intricate compositions.\n- Three different styles (Grid, Punch Card and Mixed) set the foundation.\n\t- The Grid style is based on a simple grid of elements with varying levels of density.\n\t- While the Punch Card style is essentially also a grid, it has a different rhythm to it, at times very sparse with isolated clusters, at other times those clusters and elements are connected together almost resembling sheet music. In some instances the Punch Card can be very dense almost to the point of saturation.\n\t- The Mixed style is a blend of the two aforementioned and introduces a higher degree of variations and somewhat unexpected results.\n\n- There are 16 palettes, each one of them named after a city. The colours are extracted from personal travel photos to those cities before being fine tuned.\n\n- The Cyrillic glyph is the centre piece of the composition, sometimes bold and in the foreground, at times fragmented and sometimes even hidden, as if an invitation to the viewer to look closer and explore the many layered details.\n\n- The other traits that make up the piece may have less depth in their meaning but add to the overall amount of graphical variations.\n\nEach iteration of _Such A Lovely Time_ is a generative attempt at technical aesthetics.\n\nCreated by petitsapin (Dominique McKerl Dautheribes).", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/37694fafcf405da629306be51fec3b59.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

Hold on! Hold on!\nI like to think of my brain as a hand,\npalm of my soul, fragile nerve bundle.\nI think about my brain as I hold my heart\nin both hands — a private thing, a pulsing secret.\nIt fills my palms and bones with heat.\nThe world is full of heartbeat.\nI am trying to hold it all together...*\n    &nbsp; -- &nbsp;Excerpt from *STILL MOVING*, by Technelegy\n\n**NOTE: To fully experience *STILL MOVING*, please open in LIVE VIEW and enable your webcam for motion tracking.**\n\nThe first project of its kind, *STILL MOVING* is an interactive poem about humanity’s visceral engagement with the virtual – written and published via the blockchain as a token word performance, and embodied by each collector as a uniquely intimate, personalized interpretation. In this epic on-chain ode to the relationship of bodies and machines, literal and figurative wordplay activates the liminal space between text and reader, extending the two-dimensional screen/page into a somatic, material realm where language moves us in every sense of that phrase – up, down, sideways, forwards, backwards, and in otherwise inexpressible directions – urging us to reclaim our dynamism and intuitive physicality in an age of technological acceleration, bodily inertia, and rote gestures.\n\nA collaboration between Nathaniel Stern and Sasha Stiles – rooted in Stiles’ AI-powered verse and Stern’s career in digital, interactive, and networked art – *STILL MOVING* is an ars poetica about what it means to be a human body facing a machine: a showdown, a form of worship, a distraction, a mirror gaze, an other, an alter, an alter. After we bend to our technologies, do we spring back into shape, or assume new forms? Where does input end, and output begin? As we continue to think, work, and play faster than ever while rooted in place, it is still possible to be moved – *really* moved?\n\n*STILL MOVING* also embodies the future of web3 literature, in which the book – read-only – evolves into a read-write-interact experience, and authors begin to adopt such tools as webcams and NFTs in their writerly arsenal. In each unique edition of *STILL MOVING*, camera-based motion tracking (data confined to your local machine only) facilitates a play-full and meaning-full interface between the reader’s physical self and language on screen. Human forms and gestures shape machine expression, and vice versa, cybernetic serendipity inspires poetic association. Make a move, and be moved… Stand still, and instill meaning…\n\nPalettes pair paper, charcoal, and pencil colorings – emblematic of the stationery/stationary – with neon and electric highlights that nod to computational restlessness. Preview images feature lines from the core poem, potent standalone phrases, or rare, gestural graphics and images, caught somewhere between language and illustration, expression and wordless apprehension. \n\n\n**FUNCTIONS**\n\n*Click inside the interaction area if any of the function keys below are not working.*\n\n*Space Bar* to toggle Play/Pause the interaction and animation\n\n*'d'* Downloads the current image at the screen/browser resolution\n\n*Up/Down arrows* increase/decrease camera sensitivity by 5\n(for use in high and low light situations;\n0-150, default is 90; higher numbers = more text)\n\n*Top two keyboard rows (numbers 1 thru 0 and letters q thru p)* also birth semi-mapped text\n\n*'c'* toggles Camera use (if present and on) between keyboard only or both\n\n*'v'* Views/hides the Verse (your poetry / your iteration’s text)\n\n*'f'* toggles Full screen (Live View only)\n\n*'s'* downloads / Saves the entire AI poem to the hard drive", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OfAs5WHwiE7AlYbqQfOG6xThpi5tj1t0q_0LHMSbFFKh_s7m310qpYXsvEiV8CeNopvhX0MqYxipevuUCQ6ra1qKbFL83oC2L-U"},

Pixel sorting is a procedure that isolates segments of pixels and sorts their positions based on any number of criteria (i.e. luminosity, hue, saturation). \n\nAssorted Positivity is a generative approach to making pixel sorting art without any photographic base. The algorithm uses several types of noise to generate an initial design, each one unique to the token and specifically conducive to pixel-sorting. The sorting displaces pixels in various directions based on their grayscale value; and hues determine how the sorting ends. Sometimes the sorting lends itself to a sort of drip look and other times it presents itself as depth and shading.\n\nThis project was initially influenced by my desire to sort past the ubiquitous negativity online and focus on the positivity, generosity, and genuine thoughtfulness that I have witnessed around this genart space--with collectors, artists, and people who simply appreciate the community.\n\nIntegrated into each piece is an uplifting adjective that is visible, yet blended into the art. At a glance, the viewer may not notice the steganographic message that is conveyed by an international visual method of telegraphing words.

By referencing historical precedents, Flourish produces designs that exist between the past and present, striking a balance between tradition and innovation.\n\nFlourish’s logic uses a linguistic structure that treats simple shapes like an alphabet and arranges geometry into phrases, establishing and dissolving symmetries. This logic is similar to a formal grammar system with rules that describe how words can be combined to form sentences. As a very simple example, a rule for the English language might be that a noun phrase can be followed by a verb phrase. So, a person dances, a cat sleeps, a bird sings. In the context of Flourish, pentagons can be subdivided into triangles, which can be enclosed by circles to create complex patterns. As geometry is combined and rearranged, the linguistic-like structure of the image changes, which also changes the next possible sets of geometric operations.\n\nThe palettes reflect various eras and mediums, invoking the feeling of aged archival drawings, woodblock prints, freshly inked illustrations, blueprints, and photocopies. The images resemble photographs of drawings rather than the drawings themselves, creating the impression of a carefully archived collection of artifacts that document a history just now coming into existence.\n\nIn my own history, I spent many years filling notebooks with abstract flowing drawings using very fine pens while studying painting and drawing. I would start by making one small curved mark, and then make thousands more while following the natural rhythm that my hand and wrist made. The density of marks and careful variations of spacing gave the drawings a meditative quality. Flourish's fine flowing lines draw from this meditative practice, imbuing each image with a sense of careful attention and intention.\n\nThe best architecture is a harmony of the natural and the constructed. And so the fine detailed marks are meant to feel natural, and to build up the constructed geometries with an emergent natural foundation.\n\nManipulating the arrangement of primary shapes to create complex patterns is a hallmark of both generative design and traditional architectural design. Flourish exists somewhere between this relationship. Rather than taking the historical path of contemporary parametric architecture, with its large sweeping forms and sci-fi aesthetics, Flourish creates an alternative history, a revivalist rebirth of the roaring twenties for the 2020s.\n\n------\nPrints on archival paper will be made available at a later date.\n\nA percentage of profits from the primary sale will be donated to the Hawaii Community Foundation's Maui Strong Fund to support Maui residents affected by the wildfires.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/79a613560bd2b8f8976e0aa50ccfa150.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

It has a strong focus on texture and the use of real world physics as generative rules.\n\n3000 photons spawn on a blank canvas with set direction and velocity. Hidden on the screen, an arrangement of shapes populate the space. When a photon collides with the edge of a shape, it either reflects off or refracts through its surface, changing the photon's direction and color. These photons leave small circles along their path...the only drawn element in the artwork. This painting of light both reveals the hidden forms below and ties their chaotic arrangement together. The resulting image captures the motion and evolution of the light, generating beautiful gradients and layers, and creating the illusion of depth, shadows, and highlights. \n\nPress 's' to save a snapshot of the canvas, and 'd' to reveal outlines of the shapes.\nThis artwork renders live, from a blank screen to a filled screen.

Over the 25 years of her artistic career, LIA's working process has typically involved as much intuition as it does engineering skill, and this piece is no exception. Growing from an initial Processing sketch by way of the artist's careful selection of angles, transparencies, and line weights, a virtually infinite sequence of house-like forms appears and disappears. LIA conceives of her practise as a conversation between her own fluid concepts and the formal precision required of software code; when accidents or bugs appear, they are often treated as a part of this conversation and incorporated into the final work. In this piece the “cheeky blue” and “cheeky red” features arise from a bug in calculating the colour spread, and have been retained for their aesthetic contribution to the images. Taking inspiration from the song “Little Boxes” by Malvina Reynolds, this piece is a contemplation of houses and cities. The cyclical relationship between the construction of homes, the lands and environments they have replaced, and the ecosystems that will eventually replace them is echoed through an infinite production of geometric compositions. “little boxes on the hillsides, child” is the successor of “little boxes on the hillsides, mother”, presented in the exhibition “Synthetic Imagination” at bitforms gallery San Francisco, October 2–November 15, 2021. The NFTs minted on Art Blocks are the children of the “mother” work: brilliantly colourful, they are rendered in stillness as an artifact of the mother program's generative output, whose ancestry can be activated on the Art Blocks website by pressing the 'a' key to reveal the animated process behind the production of the still image.

They are used widely in architecture, product design, and perhaps most familiarly in user interfaces. Think: desktop icons like trash cans or notepads. SKEUOMORPHS is a meditation on this digital tradition. \n\nSKEUOMORPHS picks up where RASTER left off as an another exploration of the materiality of pixels and rasterized imagery. Here the study of pixels narrows in on the shallow depth of on-screen interfaces and the play of low-res figure-ground effects. Moments of skeuomorphism where the 2-dimensional plane of the screen becomes slightly 3-dimensional through beveling or drop-shadows are extracted and used as abstract painterly details. These elements that are typically used to make computation and interfaces more familiar become unfamiliar on the canvas, suggesting the possibility of an aesthetic between abstraction and realism.\n\nSKEUOMORPHS employs recurring themes and techniques from my art practice: limited color palettes, low-res chunky pixels, dithering, and physics simulation. It uses a specific kind of dithering called R-sequence dither developed by Martin Roberts. Like traditional Bayer matrix-based dithering, this technique produces a patterned image akin to retro video games and early computer screens. In this project, the R-dither pattern results in a woven textile-like texture, which recalls the long relationship between computing and weaving. The canvas negotiates two scales simultaneously: that of the dithered pixel (rendered at 1/1024th of the canvas height) and the simulated particle that acts as a brush stroke (rendered at 1/256th of the canvas height). The two resolutions work together to produce a cohesive texture that is neither pretending to be a retrograde screen nor an analog material but something in between. Similar to RASTER, the goal is to investigate new avenues for digital aesthetics that rely on a combination of historical techniques and innovative practices.\n\nUse mouse or touch controls to interact.\nPress 's' to grab a still frame.\n\nCollectors will be eligible to receive a signed archival giclée print of their mint.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2KwF-XnOMvzoC83O9HFJ48h5z0TlCaRJ33raDUPX47a58rw4AdHucVJJjX5k2GVC3HbfadtTndcWbXxGLTo2L5g8o-RByKG3Gg"},

The conflict between intrinsic meaninglessness and our search for meaning is both absurd and liberating. We are free to create our own meaning yet ultimately, there is none. By acknowledging both the futility and the opportunity, we can find joy.\n\nThese images have no specific meaning yet often they seem purposed. Each output evokes an emotional tone, such as calm, erratic, troubled, bold, mysterious or cheerful. We are frequently reminded of something or can identify shapes like birds, houses or spaceships. Our innate tendency to find patterns and meaning is evident.\n\nThe algorithm uses geometry and rules but has been given as much freedom as possible to create varied compositions which contain both chaos and order. The compositions are constructed using node layouts, which are connected to form shapes. Connection is a recurrent theme in our pursuit of meaning - manifested in pattern formation, our relationships and the interconnectedness of the universe. The shapes are duplicated and modified through rotation, mirroring, and scaling to build up structure and chaotic form. If an output appears too sparse, an extra stage of manipulation is applied. Keypresses reveal the components, allowing viewers to observe the underlying mathematical structure of the composition. How does this insight influence our perception of meaning?\n\nThe meaning communicated by each piece is subjective, shaped by the viewer's own experiences interacting with the work. The artist aspires to connect with her audience by discovering the meanings they derive from the outputs we have yet to encounter.\n\nToggle components - \n1 - Nodes\n2 - Shapes\n3 - Extras\n4 - Strokes or Outlines (if present)\n5 - Border\nr - Return to full piece\n\ns - Save 2000px wide image\np - Save 5000px wide image", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZIienlbwMlUq8EMwyVeCgnwisxd_dPjlZxwufo1OiZYyZDPZWptzgAAgZMJRVpcFkD38l4RHi5O8rA0qEHVVDknss32UcBc07uQ"},

There was just enough depth to each compartment for room to place a miniature trinket. It was filled with all kinds of knickknacks that we often picked up from the local mall. Some of the tchotchkes would tie into our lives, but many were just fun pieces, and the overall make up of the miniature box (as we called it) became an evolving composition.\n\nThis work, Gewgaw, tries to recreate that miniature box, dividing the canvas into small compartments of various sizes and orientations. Each block contains a looping animation, from one of 16 different styles. Many outputs will focus on just one or two styles, while others will incorporate all 16. Each style has its own set of parameters to provide variety within each block. In the end, the dozens, or hundreds, of animation blocks all come together to create an overall unique and lively composition.\n\nThere are 15 palettes of varying likelihood to show up across the 200 outputs, but two in particular are special for this project. The Silver Ticket and Golden Ticket palettes will be used to provide access to a free mint (gas and fees still apply, of course) in an upcoming long-form animated generative art project. The upcoming work, Digital Bath, will be published on Highlight, and Silver Palette holders will receive 1 free mint, while Golden Ticket holders will receive 2 free mints.\n\nIn addition, special features are available for any batch mints of Gewgaw. Each iteration of a batch mint will allow for the same number of additional views (up to 9).  The same palette and animation styles will be reorganized into a new structure of blocks and can be accessed by using the number keys. For example, a batch of mint of 3 will provide the second work of the batch to have two views which can be switched between using keys 1 and 2.  The third mint of the batch will have three views switchable using keys 1, 2, and 3.", "imageUrl": "https://arweave.net/ja3c8T_g-8w2PaF2CwSj2aaf17tbm7RariK6kq_-TEA"},

It is the lens through which our reality is formed. It’s the filter through which we interpret and make sense of our experiences. Perspective is what shapes our beliefs, influences our decisions, and determines our attitudes about the world around us.\n\n'*Subtle*' explores the profound yet delicate role of perspective while offering a world in which scale is undefined, form is sleek, and luminescent rays rule all. Nuanced changes in vantage point and form reveal a fascinating interplay between light, complexity, and composition. Additionally, viewers can investigate these relationships interactively or turn on *Gallery Mode* for an ever-changing experience.\n\nThis series is heavily inspired by Gall’s Law, which states that “all complex systems evolve from simpler ones,” and aspires to strike a balance between intricacy and simplicity, while retaining its core values of light, color, and tone.\n\n‘*Subtle*’ is built on nearly 15 years of experimentation with luminescent beams, starting with the acclaimed web game Auditorium, as reimagined in the art show “We’ve Traveled so Far,” and fully realized here.\n\nEach unique creation is generated through a wholly bespoke WebGL implementation. At runtime, all attributes and features are combined to realize a completely distinctive GLSL Fragment Shader. Finally, the piece is rendered to your screen using a technique called Raymarching. All of this in just 12.2kb of Javascript.\n\n## Controls:\n- [ **spacebar** ] *Change Perspective*\n- [ **mouse/finger drag** ] *Interact*\n- [ **g** ] *Toggle Light Beams*\n- [ **h** ] *Toggle Hi-Res Interactivity Mode*\n- [ **enter** ] *Gallery Mode* - changes perspective every 10s\n- [ **1-6** ] *Change Antialiasing ( low-high )*\n\n## Notes:\n- Requires a WebGL capable browser\n- Render resolution up scales with viewport dimensions.\n- A black and white low-res preview is used for interaction.

From the early days in his photo darkroom, I learned that photography is all about creating connections. My father Heinz Hosch was my icon. A photojournalist, brave and without fear, a world traveler, risking his life at many front lines, from Vietnam to Western Africa, always there to capture the one photo that told the story. He was my first teacher and I lost him at the age of 52. He was not killed in these wars but in the end I believe it was the wars that killed him. On March 11th, I was able to celebrate my 52nd birthday, the age he was when he so unexpectedly passed away in 1981. This is when I made a decision that would change the course of my life: I would keep his cameras, become a photographer, and continue his legacy. “52icons” is a personal collection of 1/1 portraits (+1879 Iggys) that capture some of the most famous faces of our time, including my father, forever in my heart and now forever living on the blockchain.

These tilings lie at the intersection of complex mathematical problems and gorgeous visual aesthetics arising from finite amounts of simple objects.\n\nThis project introduces novel ways to use Penrose tiles. Unlike in traditional deterministic usage of these tiles, stochasticity plays a very important part of the script. Randomness can affect things like the total amount of the tiles used, their orientation, coloring, and size. Familiar patterns can be witnessed in some outputs and yet they are completely absent in others.

As the layers all possess some level of transparency, light passes through the paint, hitting the canvas and reflecting back toward the viewer. This creates an otherworldly, glowing, living effect that is inimitable by any other means. The nature of the technique requires a tremendous amount of time--the more glazes, the more rich and beautiful the effect--and is very unforgiving of mistakes. The artist that dedicates to this slow, careful, path--to return, again and again, layer after layer, week after week--will bring a rare and singular beauty into the world.\r\n\r\n*This collection features an Open Edition, a 24-hour [1/1 Auction](https://www.niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x464436fa5a31b0923922d56d6e755e53927260b6/1), a [100 edition FCFS](https://www.niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x464436fa5a31b0923922d56d6e755e53927260b6/2) (for previous collectors only), and an exclusive [airdrop](https://www.niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x464436fa5a31b0923922d56d6e755e53927260b6/3) (for Claire Silver's 1/1 holders).
