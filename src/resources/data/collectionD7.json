After a millennia of slumber it must again usher its minions into the expanse. It must sustain. It must replenish. So it guides its horde out to the stars, visiting countless worlds to restart the cycle. For an eternity the cycle has repeated, minding and tending this garden of worlds. Now it is time for the garden to give back. This event has come to be known as *The Harvest*.\n\n*The Harvest* depicts worlds that exist in eternal symbiosis with the Caretaker. We witness the spectacle of monumental chromatic beams as they impact the surface of these beautiful, alien bodies. The Caretaker assigns different constellations to each planet, giving rise to unique combinations of beams as they extract the much needed nectar. This project has been inspired by a life-long fascination for science fiction and space exploration. Aiming to capture a moment of awe, the beams reach to their origin, emulating a cathedral-like atmosphere in the vein of Hugh Ferriss, while borrowing inspiration from Micheal Whelan’s landscapes. All in the effort of capturing a sense of how small we are in relation to the cosmos.\n\n*The Harvest* is built on p5js, and takes advantage of its 3d api. With the orthogonal view enabled, the algorithm uses volumetric rectangular units to create the stylised illusion of alien landscapes. Each beam has a position, color, reach and yield that is calculated and procedurally drawn over time.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/e66607aa87a89005b573e509f8fa1ab0.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

The number 108 is a reference to bonnō, or earthly temptations.\n\nMurakami.Flowers NFTs are subject to the Collector Terms available here: https://murakamiflowers.kaikaikiki.com/collector.html.

The first lunar calendar, dated to 32,000 BC was discovered, drawn on animal bone in caves. It's believed hunters during the last Ice Age used these portable lunar calendars to anticipate the behavior of different animals like Mammoths. Since then, our Moon has been imprinted across all our ancient and modern cultures, even becoming the system from which our Gregorian calendar evolved from. In the present day, investors in crypto have used the Moon symbolically. \n\nWhat does it mean for all of us in crypto to be so ahead of our time, all while using the same metaphor of the Moon for the various measures of success and individual goals we collectively share in crypto? And how will the future appreciate our ambitions and perseverance within the present moment's growing pains on our way to mass adoption? These are some of the questions that Gazers ask.\n\nOn the surface, Gazers function as a lunar calendar, algorithmically synching closely with Moon phases in the sky, joining the blockchain with one of humanity's longest running lineages in art. Gazers seeks to create a community of collectors celebrating the change of our perceptions that happen over time, our collective goals in crypto, and our love of color theory, astronomy, and generative art. \n\nWhat we are building in blockchain and NFTs will primarily be for the benefit of the future. As such, this artwork was designed to pace itself and speed up its frame rate over time, scaling into anticipated advancements in technology that will steadily allow the artwork to run at faster speeds while at larger scales. Each NFT starts out with the assignment of a date from the past 20 years. These dates correspond to events that happened under particular New Moons that shaped my path as an artist. This is the Origin Moon trait and how Gazers is in part a conceptual self portrait. \n\nStarting from the Origin Moon, each New Moon that arrives will speed up the potential animation of the NFT. For example, an NFT with a 20 year old Origin Moon might run at 20 frames per second, appearing as an animation. But one with an Origin Moon fresh from the sale will run closer to 1 frame per second, appearing more like a slowly evolving painting. Every moment, the frame rate of the artwork speeds up fractionally, indecipherable to our eyes. Stacking these advancements over time creates a generational evolution of experience. There is something undeniably beautiful about everything speeding up within our lifetimes, but the Moon, high above us, continues to carry on at the same meandering rate of 29.53 days in each cycle. Much like these blockchain technologies and NFT markets, this artwork was designed to be collected by the present, but appreciated in a greater sense than we can even imagine by the future. \n\nI created Gazers to be like a living artwork, to be lived with, and to not only have the artwork evolve over time but also the appreciation and experience of viewers. As I coded the work, I imagined it hanging on the wall of collectors, a fixture in their physical space. Collectors might spend a moment admiring their work, walk away for a couple hours, and then come back to be delighted, noticing the most subtle of shifts. Each layer of the work consists of pattern designs. With the passage of time, the thickness of the layered lines pulse and the direction a design moves will advance or rotate, changing our perception of color in the most subtle and optical of ways. Each day at midnight, each layer receives a new set of rules in terms of how to rise or shine over the next 24 hours. The result is color that rises and sets, echoing the change of light in our sky.\n\nMy use of color has consistently been what I've been best known for across my 20 year artistic career. In all my work until now, I've made all the color and design choices as I've painted as a human in the moment. But in Gazers, I designed a complex system around color theory as I understand it, joining my talent for coding with my vision for color. \n\nMany NFT collectors of my work might be familiar with the additional experiences some of their NFTs unlock at my website. Rather than use a Gazers NFT to unlock a website, I decided this time to create rendering modes that unlock within the code over time. These additional modes of viewing are intended to help a collector better understand the architecture of their artwork's design and also benefit from greater enjoyment of it. The addition of these experiences should present an additional benefit to HODLing for some. \n\nEvery 29 and a half days, we reach a Moon phase called the New Moon. This is when the dark side of the Moon is fully visible and no sunlight is reflected from the lunar surface back to Earth. In Gazers, each New Moon phase creates a New Moon design. In this artwork, the hash seed creates color theory and design rules. These rules are deterministic and dictate all the moons that will generatively be created into infinity. Time reveals our moons. Pairing time with deterministic generative code creates the ephemeral moment. We can all agree that looking at the Moon in the sky never seems to be the exact same experience twice, nor the exact same from different locations. I wanted to echo this nature in Gazers and emphasize the urgency and rarity of our present moment and how an artwork can capture this. \n\nAs individuals, we all have our own version of the Moon and what reaching it means. Just as our goals change over time, often subtly, sometimes dramatically, so will our moons, creating a visual representation that might coincide with what's changing inside of us. In crypto, we are all ahead of our time. We are all gazers. And we are all waiting for our next Moon.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pepqUFeetYERaIb1kC9AtXGwvHDQ27ejxY4Y3rrWGh_N9WVepMRe6vBcm-DbMpJxoAfys3Rjb74INOvHl3BQ7f_uXF9_qvqy2A"},

Each unique output of /// is segmented into various motifs, each depicting different stages of a Formula One race from the anticipatory tension before the red lights go out to the exhilarating rush of the fastest moments in the race. Snowfro seeks to encapsulate the quintessence of motion in the most minimal form, while also unfolding a chromatic narrative through two distinctive color traits—the inner color style and the border color style.\n\n/// is a multi-dimensional ode to the essence of motion, minimalism, and the relentless forward momentum that propels not just racers, but every individual forward in the race of life.\n\nThis work was exhibited as part of Velocity Series by Oracle Red Bull Racing and Bybit.

Snowfro) has been intrigued by the idea of representing digital artwork in the physical world in the form of an ephemeral physical object with meaning, but with no inherent value. \n\nDonald Judd has long been an inspiration for Art Blocks. One aspect we admire most about Judd’s artistic practice is the elegance of design he effortlessly paired with the accessibility of materials that could be found at a hardware store. With Judd as inspiration, we hatched a plan to create a unique generative art friendship bracelet that includes instructions to make, in minutes, a simple bracelet using a few dollars’ worth of embroidery floss. Donald Judd believed that what surrounds us in our day-to-day life is already so beautiful, and that ultimately the experience of creating art is as important as owning it.\n\nErick was incredibly excited to collaborate with renowned artist Alexis André (a.k.a. MacTuitui) to bring generative art and ephemeral physical objects together in the form of friendship bracelets. Conceptualized by Erick and aesthetically and programmatically designed by Alexis, this project pairs creative coding with a beautiful spectrum of embroidery floss colors. The project was a true team effort, as each member of the Art Blocks team designed and named their own color palette!\n\nThe project is a token of our appreciation to the creators, makers, builders, and collectors who have all contributed to making the Art Blocks community what it is today. Participating in this project is a signal, both online and IRL, that you’re a participant in this evolution of art + community. You are pushing the best ideas forward. You are the reason all of these imaginative projects come to life. Our community is what makes all of this possible. So, to say it plainly, we appreciate you, and we hope that you’ll accept this bracelet as a token of our special friendship!\n\nThe owner of any wallet with an Art Blocks piece at the time of snapshot (October 26, 2022, at 3pm US Central time) is eligible to claim two mints from this special generative art project. We would love to see you keep one bracelet and share your love for generative art by gifting your second mint! These mints are free to claim (you pay only the gas) and exist on L1 Ethereum. Please note that we may in the future release additional modified iterations of the Friendship Bracelets project, ideally on an L2 scaling solution, that may substantially increase the total supply of tokens related to the project, with the intent of being a more accessible entry point to a larger audience. But this version is what we're here to celebrate today, and this gift is for you in gratitude for your support along the way. Please enjoy this token of our friendship and explore the wonderful artwork created by Alexis André. Then, let's all make bracelets together! \n\nWarmly,\nAlexis + Erick + the Art Blocks team\n\n\n\nThe claim window expires on January 10, 2023, at noon US Central time.\n\nClick into the Display Notes for information about making your bracelet.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/P3oEmfNNRGQgkLA1z3ya7NBdjlw_BXuStDPEoEzGiCcqykQlDh5wJgzOet2DE88cv8hNUTgA33DwO54O7mni1No_5alxHqY84-vy"},

I saved my favorite picture files and small free software files to floppy disks with a capacity of roughly 1 megabyte and stored them carefully. Those floppy disks were my treasure. Later, when the disks deteriorated and became unreadable or were lost, the data became memories with a deep feeling of loss.\n\nBlockchains have arisen. Are these truly persistent?\n\nAfter all, digital data are also a type of memories. They are stored in a person's mind, deteriorate, and one day will be lost with that person.\n\nI find the fragility and beauty in them.\n　\n\n\n\n\n\n　\nIn this work, I attempted to represent a fictional collapsed blockchain world with visuals and sound.\n　\nThe chain has already been abandoned, and the few nodes that remain barely alive are just maintaining their appearances. Visualizing the remnants of blocks that no longer serve their original purpose, they form something like a submerged city. Then, a large amount of data that has lost its connection to the blocks and has deteriorated to the point that it can no longer be opened, flutters through the sky. The countless remnants of data form a cloud, which undulates like a wave. The details of the data cannot be confirmed, however, they can be seen as glittering lights. As I try to recall the contents of the data that can no longer be opened, I am filled with vague memories and a sense of nostalgia.\n\nThis work started with generating sound by code. The sound of rippling waves can be heard by clicking on the screen. Since it would be impractical to store huge sound data on the blockchain, the sound was formed from white noise. In order to reproduce the sound of rippling waves, it was necessary to deepen my understanding of the structure of the sound by referring to academic papers. Then the sound was completed, and the visual imagination expanded from there.\n\nI like to visit the sea near my home and in other places. Different seascapes can be seen from different locations and angles. When I am there, idly gazing at the seascape and listening to the sound of the waves, I sometimes feel as if I am the only human there and the world has gone to ruin. If the world were ruined, this seascape and the sound of the waves would remain for a long time. This feeling and the fragility felt in digital data are the basis of this work. I imagine that the heaven or the graveyard where the lost data flies up in the sky and arrives may be a seascape like this.\n\nThe reason why I used data as lights and clouds drifting in the sky and moved them like waves is because I wanted to depict unrealistic behavior with a realistic subject matter and to express a beautiful and bizarre world in which these intertwine.\n\nFor the visual expression technique, I further pursued and evolved the drawing system that I have developed in \"GHOST IN THE CODE\" and my other works. Everything is composed of rectangles, indicating that this world is beginning to become low-resolution. Depth is linked to the size of the rectangles, and distant objects are represented by small rectangles as if they were in focus. Dispersion in the position and color of the rectangles indicate the degree of deterioration of the world. Moreover, the sky, blocks, and the surface of the water are identified and each has its own characteristics.\n\nAlgorithms generate various compositions, colors, and other features. I have attempted to make each output feel nostalgic and fresh at the same time. The blocks, which have lost their original meaning, are contrasted with the data, which exists in isolation from them, in stillness and movement. Occasional red clouds or blocks mean that they are corrected as red, the first color, due to missing information.\n\nThrough these integrations, I have attempted to create a work that can be stored on a blockchain, and that is both visually and sonically interactive.\n\n[NOTE]\n\n-To save the image press the 'S' key.\n-To change the flow velocity press the '↑' or '↓' key.\n\nModern hardware and browser hardware acceleration is recommended.

It is painting new patterns on the fly in between macro and micro compositions with a duality of different rhythms and continuous synchronicity. The focus is alternately drawn to detail, then distracted by movement elsewhere and caught up in the overall picture. This rhythm turns the visual complexity into an active experience.\n\nASDF: “My work should offer individual ways of interpretation, or even allow one to find some self in it. It wants to inspire some thoughts about dynamics and systemics and also just mesmerize the audience, capture them in a little fantasy, or just for a brief moment in a state of satisfaction.”\n\nCargo is the latest work in Kim Asendorf’s ongoing work series of pixel pattern animations. Starting with [monogrid](https://monogrid.xyz) in 2021, and [Sabotage](https://sabotage.kim) in 2022, both highly conceptual series, therefore visually very raw and unimaginable. Asendorf discovered various interesting details in these works, which eventually became fundamental in his artistic expression.\n\nCargo is a real time WebGL software written in JavaScript and GLSL. At its core is a flip-flop render buffer, also known as feedback buffer. That means the animation is alternately rendered in two different frame buffers. This technique allows the usage of the previous frame of the animation as an asset in the current rendering, which allows for a series of reactive animation strategies.\n\nAn initial image with variable structures and patterns is rendered and subsequently loaded into the frame buffer. A fragment shader is used to apply a set of animation algorithms that make the pixel move and a set of reset algorithms that constantly try to recreate the initial image. The final animation happens in selected containers and is always a combination of two algorithms, one from each set. By regularly animating and partially resetting the pixels, a wide range of movement patterns appear.\n\nCargo is a responsive and pixel exact artwork and it will fill the screen on any display size, thus changing the total amount of used pixels accordingly. This results in the fact that the detail level in the artwork is changing depending on the dimensions. The overall structure is consistently stretching the x and y axis independently. Single containers scale along the dimensions and offer more pixels to render the patterns at a larger representation compared to a smaller representation. This behavior leads to a brilliance, perfect pixels, a crisp rendering with nothing like compression artifacts.\n\nThis software includes the [simplex noise](https://github.com/jwagner/simplex-noise.js) JavaScript implementation by Jonas Wagner and the [cellular noise](https://github.com/stegu/webgl-noise) GLSL code by Stefan Gustavson.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YStoMZzvSrc9jrbZwj3d84GAiyqVTwsJLehjLTC_VP7RTs1Is6euMyF0KN8k-JDuJAxfLLf-95Klwi45sZjHnGTL--jtvQp3Il0"},

Pictograms and hieroglyphics turned into paintings, which eventually became moving images and photoreal graphics. Spoken words evolved into written text, eventually becoming complex screenplays, computer code, and a world of hyperlinks. Most mediums are not discarded, but combined or extended to incorporate new technology or ideas. \n\nWhen a new medium comes into existence, the capabilities of both the artist and viewer increase. The potential subjects within said medium can grow in complexity as well, some fully dependent on the medium that holds them. Other subjects are timeless, popping in and out of multiple movements and genres throughout history. An example of the latter is still life. From ancient carvings through contemporary art, scenes of commonality, beauty, and metaphor have persisted. Traditionally viewed as a type of technical practice or meditation (the bottom of the “hierarchy of genres”), some examples of still life have gone on to be among the most important works in art history. \n\nChimera is a natural progression of still life. It is an old tradition in the very new medium of on-chain generative art, a movement that will have an enormous presence in the future. Chimera simultaneously reaches into the past while exploiting the capabilities of the present and seeks to represent a unique moment in time, a generation of art in between digital and physical realities, encapsulating where we came from and where we are going. \n\nNOTES:\n\nChimera is graphically intensive. Modern hardware is recommended. Ensure that your browser has hardware acceleration enabled.\n\nThe charitable portion of this release will be donated to various cancer research efforts.\n\nCONTROLS:\n\n“A”: Toggle animations\n“R”: Toggle autorotation\n“C”: Capture screenshot\n“H”: Capture HD screenshot (CPU intensive) \n\n—\n\nThank you to all that participate in, share, or otherwise support this release.

Little now is known of that time, other than that it reshaped the earth and brought magic into the world. The time of the Singularity was brought to an end by a cataclysm known as the Schism, an event that separated magic from the Runiverse, sending it to a realm called the Elsewhere, and with it, the wizards of the Singularity. For many centuries following the Schism, all seemed well; humanity moved on and some remnants of magic remained to aid in the rebuilding of society. \n\nBut all was not well. Something was growing along the edge of reality, eating away the Runiverse, bit by bit, a plague known as the Absence; a creeping fog that swallowed not just the land, but all memory of what was once there.\n\nNow, the world is on the brink. The Absence has nearly swallowed the whole of the physical Runiverse. Nearly all has been forgotten. What is remembered is fragmented and unreliable. But there is still hope.\n\nWith a little help from the few remaining mages in the physical world, a window from the Elsewhere has become a door to the Runiverse. The wizards of the past who were once banished must return magic to the world in order to restore the memory of what was, and push back the Absence.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/s/raw/files/10772e31e9dba89aa7dc6c12c105fe25.gif?w=500&auto=format"},

The main environmental parameter of the composition is the determination of a season of the year. The season determines the landscape’s colors and defines specific phenomena for each of them, such as rain in summer, snow in winter, petals falling in autumn, and pollen in spring. The flower has several possible variables, which can be macro aspects, affecting the entire population of the species, or micro, affecting each individual of the species differently. For example, the number of petals can be equal in all individuals or not. The number of filaments and other structures of the flower can undergo minor deviations, generating small mutations. The confusion between the figure (plant) and the background (earth, sky, other natural elements) is fascinating from a compositional point of view. The background colors are, most of the time, colors present in the figures, often breaking the boundary between them and, therefore, generating chromatic masses. In this project I also intend to research the following question: How to create parameters that resemble a living organism's growth? In this sense, the project approaches digital morphogenesis and the development of procedural organisms.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MzAJlgi8SpY3feDhGTCort9aRlbPCd27NPi-2-jUTGMY_I_1dGLr8jufCk79QEkm0_er8mMpg2M6kBm38ya-hXx6UhBqH92QhGM"},

The first element within the sculpture, akin to a black hole, is a shape that defines itself through the surrounding characteristics it draws in. This halo of characteristics, like a beautifully radiant glass cover, symbolizes the constructed personality. Casting light on these black shapes, shielded by the identities they exhibit, the algorithm invites us to question our perceptions of those we encounter. How deeply do we truly know the people in our lives? It challenges us to consider if changing the perspective could alter our perception of them, while also offering the opportunity to simulate such a change with the help of animation. Perhaps the nature of our identities is as varied as the angles from which they are viewed?\n\nBlind Spots serves as a depiction of my mental journey, transforming abstract thought patterns into a solidified artifact in the medium of generative art. The narrative is inspired by the diverse ways in which we perceive each other, a theme born from countless personal encounters. From a technical standpoint, it steps into uncharted territory for me, being the first artwork to emphasize high-resolution printing capabilities while maintaining real-time animation, a central element in my artwork. It is also my first on-chain project, prompting a restructure of the previous workflows.\n\nVisually inspired by *Iittala - Kaleidoscope* exhibition, which displayed a mesmerizing interplay of glass sculptures and light, Blind Spots features a gradient backdrop punctuated by black shapes that undulate under the influence of a transmission shader, mimicking the iridescent shimmer of pearls. The geometry of the glass cover is crafted through the algorithmic movement of two curves revolving around each other. To produce high-resolution images suitable for printing, a bucket rendering technique with overscan was developed.\n\nArticulated through two elements within each portrait, Blind Spots presents a visual metaphor for a human. This duality also echoes our presence on social media — carefully crafted showcases projecting a polished persona while concealing the authentic self. Together, the elements form a unique character from every point of view.\n\n## Controls\n- [ click ] - toggle animation\n- [ s ] - save the current frame as an image\n\n## URL parameters (see display notes)\n- [ ?animate ] - animation on by default\n- [ ?fill ] - responsive version to fill the browse\n- [ ?width=x ] - render image with x width\n- [ ?print ] - enable high-resolution mode (eg. ?print&width=10000)\n- [ ?grainSamples=x ] - between 1 - 10\n- [ ?refractSamples=x ] - between 1 - 5", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/A9fyBvVH5eCauaHFhR5prBn66IOlU7ZCeV2gRfg859erwxTzr_GEgmHB2hcKwG6OJBxjT7Cr0ayhxmrsieQsiW637aVwrPNT-a4"},

It is inspired by the aesthetics inherent in screen printing along with the compositions and colors of both Bauhaus, Constructivism, and pulp fiction sci-fi covers.\n\nThe compositions in \"Screens\" is based purely on strict geometries and plays with the tension, and symphonies that can be created from combining simple rules. The end result can range from chaotic non-figurative to strongly ordered isometric scenes.\n\nThe generative system underlying the rendering mimics the screen printing process by rendering and applying a single color at a time to a master image. Each virtual screen may be more or less aligned with the master, creating a lovely flawed balance to the precision of the rendered geometry.\n\n25% of the proceeds from this project will be donated to Den Blå Planet, The Danish National Aquarium, in support of their work on preserving and restoring marine life and ecology.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/n2xsI88RBBV8vxkQVvBlfO_4EVey3097-pgK29Oid-Id7aOGZrwE1qvi6eZBjiwrSfYEFTEsjvr_OXwDOkeBc_f_4EhnRFUVKg"},

Bringing together choreography, code, blockchain, generative art, and cryptography, the work culminates in a live performance. Each output is driven by the motion data of its underlying unique, on-chain choreographic sequence. The sequences behind the first 100 minted works (mint #2 to #101) will be performed during the IRL premiere. The hosting art institution will be announced in 2023. \n\nA journey of slowly recovering the human unfolds as such: 1) reveal on Art Blocks, 2) uncover the choreographic score, and 3) final performance. After the reveal, the human is still unreadable, visible only through the results of movement on glass, obfuscated by code, rendered as a still image. In the next phase of the work, collectors get a glimpse at their underlying choreography by unlocking the secondary token—an on-chain choreographic score. In the final phase, the performance, life is breathed into the human movement that has been lying dormant inside the pieces. **Human Unreadable** brings flesh and viscerality into code and \"vulnerability as a feature\" into long-form generative art. What you don’t immediately see in the visual artwork outputs is the invisible potentiality of performance, inscripted on-chain and able to be brought to life by a dancer at any moment. \n\n **Human Unreadable** intentionally punctures the safety of modernist design and the idea of a universal voice, pushing the limits of human expression within rigid technical systems. With a focus on the body, the collection brings risk, chaos, confusion, and vulnerability to the reveal, everything that function-focused design systems normally prevent. Each piece is an invitation, a transparent layer through which the messy human experience can come into focus through the three phases of the work. This work is a continuation of the pivot away from modernism, clean lines, and the quietly gendered values therein, in favor of a more embodied and sensual approach to human-machine collaboration pioneered by early women in digital art. **Human Unreadable**'s 6 distinct looks derive from the core materiality of Operator’s Privacy Collection: glass, light, x-ray and the human body. The transparent and illuminating nature of these materials reveal what is below the surface.\n\nWhat are you revealing when you reveal?\n\n**Human Unreadable** has roots in various histories such as computational choreography (Analivia Cordeiro, Jeanne Beaman), Merce Cunningham's Chance Dance, and the Experiments in Art and Technology movement. With Ti’s extensive background as an HCI technologist and multimedia artist and Catherine’s background as a choreographer and performance artist, Operator architected a bespoke team, 25+ individuals ranging from specialized engineers to dancers, who embarked on a 9 month process to realize the work. Operator's on-chain generative choreography method is the technical backbone of **Human Unreadable**—the process and open source tooling for which will be made available via white paper in 2023.  \n\n\n***Additional Information***\n\n**First Minter Benefits** \nThe first 100 minted pieces (mint #2 to #101) from the collection will be performed in the IRL premiere in an art institution. \n-Mint #2 to #101 will be counted as the first 100 mints. Mint #0 and #1 are artist mints held by Operator.\n-Hosting art institution will be announced in 2023. \n-Additionally, Privacy Key 00 holders will have one of their collected Human Unreadable sequences performed.\n\n**Choreographic Score (secondary token)** \n-The secondary token will be released at the end of June 2023.\n-The secondary token is a choreographic score that represents the unique choreography that generated the output minted on Art Blocks. For this reason, the Art Blocks token and the secondary token are bound together and cannot be transferred separately.\n-The underlying choreographic score visible through the secondary token can be performed by a choreographer or dancer at the collector's discretion.\n\n**GPU Intensive Rendering / Live Preview** \nThis piece involves GPU intensive composition and rendering of programmatically drawn body parts, generative glass objects, x-ray shaders as well as motion paths. As a result the ‘live preview’ on your laptop or phone may look less detailed than the PNG on Art Blocks which is rendered by a high powered computer. Not to worry!\n\n**Official Token-gated Prints** \nHuman Unreadable collectors will be able to purchase Operator official, signed, token-gated prints (on hand-selected materials) of their collected piece(s).", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WhZdpCPxyUOU5HMBjf3WuLfXTUfqVGriBKuurI_cq_XbPUdp3CmpuBknVhQF1m3JP2ZaG7k6RElRjrLXHLklpKD6x3yyfc-rtA"},

His use of saturation, experimentation with density and negative space, and flow fields serves to emphasize not only this sense of disconnection, but more importantly remind the viewer that we are still part of a larger whole.

A personal obsession, I drew and redrew it hundreds of times until I felt it reached the perfect form in balance, weight, and drama.\n\nThis generative series revisits my captivation with this character object, using the algorithm as a tool for continued obsession and exploration. I want people to experience this collection and never see a “2” in the same way again. I also want to remind viewers that exquisiteness can exist in any mundane thing.\n\nMy background in graphic design and typography is ingrained in how I think. Regardless of medium, I have always been a designer of iteration, exhaustively trialing possibilities within a set of constraints to uncover the best way, or the most ways. Twos takes a “perfected” form and puts it to a further test. Different outputs situate the form in different contexts, look at it askew, or emphasize isolated parts of it for endless results.\n\nThe texture within the collection is inspired by low resolution effects (pixelation) and textures that arise from analog printmaking techniques and pen lines. It blends the hand-drawn nature of my original “2” with the power of obsessive exploration only possible with computer generative iteration. Layers of tiny squares, under and above the characters, are used to mimic the texture of a pen or a stamp. Found in much of my work, these “visible pixels” represent the physical module upon which digital art is created - and by calling back to pixel art, act as a reminder that code is still a craft, and the generated image isn’t far from the artist’s hand.\n\nBeyond the beauty of the form, the number two is a special quantity because it implies possibilities beyond itself. A system containing zero or one elements is inert. Two creates an interaction, a dyad, and implies the possibility of more than two – an expanding system. In computer programming, this is expressed as the \"zero, one, infinity\" rule. The two represents a potentially endless continuation.\n\nEach feature in the collection represents either the analog or the digital journey of this character. Some compositions render each symbol as linework, reminiscent of its earliest hand drawn form. Others render it as the solid numeral, completed after its long journey of iteration. Some compositions are gridded, others are organic and loose. Some are contained by a frame, others are open and unrestrained.\n\nColor enters a few outputs: the mark of new technological tools like the first colored ink in printing, or the move from black and white to digital screens. The brightest hues used depend on light emittance of the screen and wouldn’t translate exactly when printed in standard inks. But in a further application of constraint, most outputs are neutral in color, keeping the focus on the formal obsession with this small, beautiful character.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/2925f459f0a95ac8a7b6088677051e8c.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

The illness is in my family and in that of close friends of mine, and this work is more of a raw expression of emotion than anything else. Holding hands with a person who is fading away is a strong experience, one that allows oneself to recalibrate and to, in a way, regenerate one's vision of what life is, what a person is, what relationships are. It's commonplace to hear that a loved one who is already gone is still alive \"in our memory\". The truth is that this is the case when we are all alive and good as well, but only take notice when there is a crossing over event. We don't see the person almost anymore, but there's a body there that sometimes still reacts. How much of what we ignore that is going on is relevant? Is this song we just played relevant? What do emotions look like when the brain that processes them is failing? Are we ready to understand those, with our limited knowledge of what we are? Is the person still there when there is no sign of them? And when they are not there, why can we not cut the cord? The simple touch of their skin is enough to make the person come alive in that instant in our very memories. Maybe we are in theirs, in that moment, in a shape we don't comprehend.\n\nVisually, the project merely projects faces. Fading, waving. Unstable, some smiling, some sad. A diversity of lives emerges in the piece, exploring with generative techniques the emotions of you, the experiencer of the piece. Maybe it does not resonate with you, but maybe it gives you a chance to connect with those feelings that are otherwise hard to get close to. We see a person and their dreams, their ideas, their memories as dancing colorful geometries. Their fears, ther recurring thoughts. But sometimes they look like a nightmare. Sometimes they are mute. We see some lines where the faces are enclosed. These are a template for a human, the lines that dictate where our facial features should be. But they dance with the memories as time passes by - is our notion of human also a moving target? Sometimes you will see more than one face, an expression of the many lives we might have lived. And at any time, we can summon a view of the piece where we see you in me. _You in me_.\n\nAllowing ourselves to be a companion of someone else's difficult passage is a window into our own humanity. An occasion for regeneration.\n\nWorks best on Chromium browsers. Firefox macos has some problem with geometries drawn with p5.js in webGL mode.

Taking DRIFT’s widely exhibited Meadow installation as a point of departure, Schema comprises 300 unique, generative, and animated artworks uniting DRIFT and Davis’s artistic visions. \n\nThis collaborative new project is inspired by the beauty and simplicity of DRIFT’s two-dimensional schematic designs for Meadow, an upside-down landscape in which illuminated mechanical flowers open and close as part of a poetic choreography. Hung from a ceiling, this mesmeric work examines the impermanence of the changing seasons and the phenomenology of nature.\n\nAt its core, Schema is a love letter to the preliminary work that goes into realizing any large-scale art installation—in this case, diagram-making. Together, Gordijn, Nauta, and Davis developed a custom algorithm that brings the physical sculpture’s details and idiosyncrasies to life, recasting its diagrammatic origins in four possible styles: Diagram, the style that most closely resembles DRIFT’s preliminary diagrams for Meadow; Color Study, which strips out the structural elements of the diagrams and express the flowers as abstract rings of color; Sketch, which renders the flowers as line drawings with chalk-like accents; and Blueprint, which resembles the style of a blueprint.\n\nIn addition to these four different drawing styles, the project’s algorithmic system chooses two parent colors for each artwork, which may result in a wide spectrum of colors appearing across the composition from left to right or, alternatively, a more monochromatic scheme. The flowers themselves also have their own color systems that determine the relationship between their physical color and the color of their internal lights, creating gradient effects as the cast light blends with the local color. \n\nVariable traits in any given Schema artwork also include: the total number and location of the flowers; day and night modes that impact ambient light effects; each flower’s apparent position relative to the viewer; and the frequency and speed at which each flower opens and closes. Flowers in these artworks also run on their own cycles, deliberately avoiding synchronization and giving the whole scene a sense of organic motion. Once the viewer clicks on a static Schema composition to activate its motion, the animations in the artwork evolve endlessly.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fRAUPcuSJfUeIxispz1D3s_e2avppgmabGKPaqprGBU8Y9DvlknPIMkTNnKZDl7Uq6eFYvKNcb2BIrBzLUqAS7G0wLVF5K-nH_7F"},

Approach any problem from a position of complete ignorance and try to find the simplest way to solve it.\n2. Make the most with as little as possible and avoid introducing complexity unless absolutely necessary.\n3. Accept that intuition often falls short in predicting the best way forward (*especially* when creating generative art), and entertain any idea that presents itself.\n\nStaying mostly within the confines set by these rules, the development of Gumbo ended up taking me on many unexpected journeys.\n\nAt its core, Gumbo explores the diversity of form that can be achieved by combining simple shapes, such as spheres, donuts, boxes, and cylinders. Despite the basic components, the final arrangements are strangely familiar, some reminiscent of space stations, others of internal organs. By painting these structural canvases in an indiscriminate fashion, an intricate interplay between colour and form arises, emphasizing the spatial nature that underlies both. Texture, a subject I deeply appreciate, stars as the main character of Gumbo, celebrated both as a reference to the material world, and, especially, as something with uniquely digital characteristics. Present throughout the project, it is primarily used to illuminate the structures and add life to otherwise flat blocks of colour.\n\nWhile working on Gumbo, I've found inspiration from a diverse set of sources, ranging from the vibrant and captivating colours of Cold War-era propaganda posters and Japanese ukiyo-e to the texture-heavy work of artists like Virgil Finlay and Bruce Conner. In addition, Gumbo utilises a rendering approach that can be described as a digital equivalent of physical methods like silkscreen and woodblock printing, a connection that was not recognised until the project's later stages.\n\n**Note**: Gumbo requires WebGL2 and is computationally expensive to render. Older devices will probably struggle!\nTo save a high-resolution render, press \"p\" while in live mode and enter the desired size (or add \"?resolution=your-size-here\" to the end of the URL).

Whether encapsulated in physical or computational techniques, these processes act with their own degree of autonomy from our own biases and as a result, open up new ideas and sensibilities while dismantling traditional notions of authorship. They allow one to code the possibility of discovery and surprise into the creative process in a manner that can be widely shared and because of this transmissibility, algorithms frustrate the idea of a single author, inviting speculation on the shared nature of creativity. For this reason we have always understood our work to be a collaboration between each other, those who share with us and those who inspire us. \n\nOver the years, the studio has indulged in a number of obsessions. One is the conviction that history is a generative source with which to constantly entangle. Whether it is through stories, characters, techniques, or events, history acts as a medium active with properties that constantly reshape and transform our concept of the present. We look back to move forward, like hitching a ride. It is here that we encounter Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528) and his masterpiece Melancholia I (1514) to inspire a deep dive into the process of engraving as a representational technique reinterpreted through the contemporary medium of code. By scratching metal away from a plate, an inversion of conventional drawing, engraving allowed a work of art to be reproduced and disseminated widely. In addition to the piece’s masterful delineation, its allegory resonates with us as well. In Dürer’s time melancholy was associated with insanity but also with creativity. In the engraving, the winged personification of melancholy -- the work is widely regarded to be a self-portrait of the artist -- is surrounded by the tools and elements of geometry. For Dürer, as for a handful of others who came before and after, who test the porous borders between art, science and religion, geometry is a vehicle for imagination, a shadow of the divine and a portal to the infinite. \n\nThis work Primitives is a kindred meditation on infinity through an exploration of a novel geometric structure using algorithm and code, the tools of today's geometers and mystics, made visible through the anachronism of the engravers trade translated into pure 1’s and 0’s. Primitives grows through a single shape that can repeat and scale in specific ways that are never random, but rather tightly governed by geometric logics. It is about drawing infinity through a radical modularity; ordered but aperiodic. Unlike a regular crystal, whose molecular pattern is periodic (or repetitive in all directions), the distinctive quality of this quasicrystal is that its structural pattern never repeats the same way twice. Endless and uneven in aggregate, Primitive clusters can be described by the precise arrangement of a single modular part. As these small units aggregate together they form larger figures that themselves combine into ever larger movements, always a little bit different from any other. In this sense, quasicrystalline patterns have an infinite capacity to create and carry information. \n\nWe are here because this is a medium for sharing in perpetuity. In the last couple of years, on the cusp of our third decade of practice, we have watched with awe and delight a renaissance in generative work as it's adopted by an entirely new generation around blockchain technologies. This inspired us to enter this new space with our own enduring questions of form and geometry, modularity and variability, historical continuity, and the thirst for endlessness. Primitives is what we selected as our primer into generative art on-chain because both the work and the medium grapple with these questions. \n\nSome Notes:\nOn the screen, Primitives is represented as a two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional figure. Each invocation comes with a sequence of projections, or rotations, around this object. As Primitives spins, there are moments when its blocks snap into alignment with other blocks  revealing its underlying lattice and crystalline nature. Each projection can be saved as a high resolution image for printing. Primitives can also be saved in three dimensions as an .obj file for a variety of uses including the creation of a physical object through 3-d printing or fabrication. Below is a list of interface instructions:\n\n'left' + 'right' arrow keys to rotate \n'up' + 'down' arrow keys to zoom in \n'g' regrows geometry \n'i' saves image \n'o' saves .obj\n\nThank you,\nAranda\\Lasch\n2022", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hW62_RI-H8gkj1M1BT0i3QcHbFhubEXLCaZJVophFXOy5HHjbpHEW8zCDh81vlGGpHVDkpzYZncWePucXyyBatxlj7CI8IVmZj4"},

To further enhance the expression of emotions, I use size and proportion symbolizing and amplifying the intensity of those feelings. This approach brings forth the emotional impact of rain in our lives, **inviting viewers to reflect on their own relationship with rain and the feelings it evokes in them.**\n\nTo add depth and significance to its compositions Forecast uses a creative approach woven into its code, that became such an important part of the piece that gave its name to the project. **The code simulates a weather forecast emulating barometric pressure, and humidity** – variables that dynamically influence a circle packing algorithm that symbolizes clouds over the canvas, generating the necessary data to calculate the probability of precipitation for each piece and distribute rain across the canvas in a visually appealing way.

Savings evaporated, treasuries wiped out, time spent building lost, and the concept of decentralized money put into question.\n\nBut we are Rekt Wolf, and our motto is Rekt Today, Stronger Tomorrow. This marks a new opportunity to expand the Rekt Wolf brand, advance our DAO, develop stronger educational material, and most importantly share our wonderful community with the world! We’re all going to Rekt it wolves! #WAGRI", "imageUrl": "https://openseauserdata.com/files/432dc8c59e369c6ebe4bbf43ff7239b1.png"},

Cerebellum is a window (pun intended) of the human mind - a continuously evolving art piece that is built on top of a reinforcement learning agent that is learning and optimizing and evolving as you see it. \n\nThe project starts with an untrained model of a reinforcement learning agent that is deployed in an environment where it is faced with positive reward and negative reward. The agent is also equipped with a bunch of eyes that lets it sense the objects around it and judge if it wants to go ahead and consume the object or abstain and move in a different direction. The agent here is optimization to maximize its positive rewards while avoiding the negative ones. How does the agent know if a reward is positive or negative? - It learns that after experiencing a bunch of samples. And the magic is - all of this happens in your browser. The seemingly random motion of the agent at the beginning running into everything it sees subsides with time as it learns better about the environment and only hits on the positive rewards. How fast does this happen? Depends on your luck - every art has agents with varied number of eyes and range of these eyes. In addition with every refresh your agent would start from a new place, taking a new path - a path that might lead to it learning things at a different pace depending on what it comes across as it explores. To add some practicality - the environment also has some walls, elements that just block the agent from moving doesn’t add or decrease rewards. Hinders the agent’s movement, lets it find a different path - sometimes this is needed for the agent to strategize, sometimes it's just a hindrance… I’ll leave this to your imagination as you see the agent in action…\nThe seemingly random motion - the path towards true understanding - the process of optimisation is captured by the windows. Windows that show the beauty of this process expressed in a variety of ways. \n\nCerebellum is a window into the black box of AI, an unapologetic exaltation of the unpolished, an ode to the process and its aesthetic vernacular.\n\n+ Press 'p' to switch from 2d/3d views\n+ Press 'e' to expose the reinforced learning layer\n+ Press 't' to pause/unpause the training of the agent\n+ Press 'w' to randomize the walls of the training environment\n\nOn mobile, tap to switch from 2d to 3d", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IXOaZrtzimk2zWsnhlbT68gNX4rSHi-at2QEXKeLrqg7BAyRDcy-9gORGm24vIS9FnKbUJ-mFYsTYo4Qyu-sOfuByv7IJzFWUGc"},

The latent spaces (the algorithmic structures that make AI image synthesis possible) can be seen as a part of our human collective unconsciousness; a hyper dimensional field of unlimited outcomes, inspired by our human symbols and language.\n\nExploring this new type of space, it sparked the idea of exploring the algorithmic essence of my own artworks. What would the structure behind my creative processes look like? What if I could visualize the algorithmic structures of my own mind that produced my artworks in the past?\n\nThese questions led me to The Field, a multidimensional machine hiding in my subconscious.\n\n# THE GENERATOR\nThe first step to reach The Field, was to capture the algorithmic structure behind all my artworks. By compressing several hundred artworks from HyperHash, EnergySculpture, UltraWave & HashCrash into a 64X64 matrix, a noise image has been created. This was done by adding up all these works together.\n\nThis noise image I call The Generator was the starting point to explore possibilities for the creation of a new work. This 64x64 matrix filled with noise data was embedded in the source of the piece and functions as the core of The Field algorithm.\n\n# THE FIELD\nThe Generator is being transformed into a multidimensional field of colors and motion, called The Field. The motions of the field relate to natural processes of creation and destruction. The field is like a fluid, solid and gas-like structure at the same time. It goes from a noisy formless state to a solid material state and back.\n\nThe field is created in a few steps. First a 2d noise pattern is being created from The Generator. This 2d pattern is made by picking random points from the 64x64 matrix. This is the fundamental background of the Field.\n\nThe second step is to use this pattern to set the field in motion. By using the color data per pixel, movement is being initiated. The colors are in that sense multifunctional, on one hand it visualizes random colors extracted from The Generator on the other hand the colors are used to set the field in motion and showing the interrelationship between the colors in an extra dimension: time. This creates the 3D effects, but also creates the effect of lighting bouncing in the field.\n\n\n# REGRESSION, DESTRUCTION & CREATION\nThe creation of the field felt for me like a form of regression. Reviewing the concepts of my previous work, thinking about what overlapped in terms of topics conceptually and design wise drew me back in time.\n\nThe main topic of this work represents is the cyclical nature of creation and destruction. By revisiting my old works and literally destroying them, this new work was created. In this way the work reflects on the causal relation between creation and destruction (what's created will someday be destroyed, something has to be created to be destroyed).

The work is informed by notions of choreography, modular pattern composition and character design.\n\nKubikino is an idiosyncratic face, made of a combination of graphical elements and colours generated by code. Using an essential library of geometries - all deriving from the circle - and primary tones, the code randomly creates new faces resembling human physiognomy, animals and traditional masks.\n\nThrough the deliberate reference to a face, Kubikino prompts contemplation on the traditional notions of identity, similarity, and persona, as well as the ongoing need to establish one's own representation within a community - from traditional masks to digital avatars. For centuries, human identity has been a source of cultural fascination, with the word \"identity\" stemming from the Latin term \"identitas,\" signifying both \"sameness\" and “oneness.”\n\nInspired by Bruno Munari's \"Faces,\" a collection of abstract portraits created using basic geometric shapes and lines, Kubikino reflects on the simplicity, playfulness, and power of design to communicate across cultures and generations.\n\nDrawing upon the influential dance theories of Rudolf Laban and Merce Cunningham, Kubikino's device process for the creation of its faces is underpinned by a sophisticated framework of modular pattern composition. The project's generated output is organised into a grid-based structure, where each section corresponds to a phrase, and the relationship between the various sections collectively generates the final composition. Referencing Laban’s Movement Analysis, each section is paraphrasing LMA's four key components: body (loop), shape (direction), dynamic (colour), space (relationship within the space).\n\nKubikino also adopts the principles of \"chance\" and \"structured improvisation\" articulated by avant-garde pioneers John Cage and Merce Cunningham in the 1960s. The Kubikino identity is constructed from a selected array of animated graphics, rules, and paradigms that correspond to motifs, scores, and ensembles found in conventional art forms such as dance, music, and paintings.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0EPFQylMQRrbBLcecP0RNlz1nzK87KJykhImlzbPqszoYW9fEDcU4fXL3YW9a6_54D36pmIzsH8AnCSudBHI3MvUcdk0uO3WgNg"},

At times they appear as strange beings; alive. To make sense of this phenomenon, we are forced to reconsider our notion of the living state beyond what we are familiar with on Earth. \n\nCalian is an infinitely zoomable and scrollable exploration of lifelike behaviour. It exhibits ambiguous natural-digital forms in a dynamic rendering. Species grow and compete; they get carried by the elements; they face boom, bust, and echo. \n\nWhat makes something alive? To go beyond recognition of terrestrial biology we need to delineate general principles and apply them to new intelligent systems. Calian uses the fruits of my research into the origin of life to create persistent, complex systems that we can experience and study (*). We can identify properties of living matter but these fall short of a satisfactory and succinct criterion. When does agency begin? Or identity? Calian asks you to ponder this as you wander through its ecosystems. \n\nFeel free to explore but be careful: although life is pervasive, living things are delicate. Your interactions affect the ecosystem, obliquely. \n\nCalian continues a thread of my work probing deep scientific questions with artistic means. It furthermore connects to my previous Artblocks projects Mazinaw and Glass through the theme of ambiguity: while Mazinaw suggested the hand of an unknown creator, and Glass visualized the intrinsic ambiguity of our quantum mechanical universe, Calian's amorphous forms bear characteristics both of familiar organic matter and digital technology. \n\nInteractive features allow you to explore each ecosystem, infinitely, both in depth and in scope. As you wander, the shader repopulates the world from its initial condition, while the physical laws governing the dynamics themselves evolve.\n\nSee Display Notes for Controls.\n\n(*) For more on Calian's dynamics and its grounding in my research, see the Calian page on my website.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KfW6VQbzYuci9Swt1-wqPlIBl_HyPgwflnNcU8CTeKh6edtsWHEQkDSRdanYtGFxL4RtohAixo-gWW1yB9uQXkcPu6-nviKZdA"},

This project is an ode to shapes derived from round-ended lines and complexity from chaos. It has inspiration from microscopic nature and movement.\r\n\r\nVisit the website: <https://avidlines.art>", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/csTwo6-qkzy2jje1WWJQI-T0Eto5EL356rXF02QnaOcaJl1jc7na1K4kpCtAf9HHqP2tXfqxaR5y5oYRQG9VnHzkWscCIEN9FVHhoy0=s120"},

Yet we fail to fully comprehend this in our daily errands. Entretiempos is an artwork that reflects on this, based on an aesthetic that pays a tribute to the works of Sonia Delaunay, František Kupka and other painters from their era, recreated by the usage of intersecting rings that create a varied and rich space.\n\nThe work plays with the time scales by painting dynamically and letting the viewer pause the work, restart, set it to loop indefinitely, painting and vanishing in an endless cycle. And it can be set to be done at varying speeds, to appreciate what happens in between the time scales (\"entre tiempos\", in Spanish).\n\nAlso, there is a broader theme that I find of interest to explore from every work that I engage with. It has to do with the concept of what I call total cognitive space, or the total range of possibilities that can be expressed / achieved with a given scenario and set of conditions. In this case, I was interested in expanding my rendition of the works of Delaunay into a broader space. How does this approach scale with varying parameter ranges? Is the painting still interesting? Can it express something new? Connected to this, I am also interested in thinking about what emotions would mean for an artificial sentient being. We talk about artificial intelligence, but leave aside artificial emotions all too often. While artificial intelligences are indeed interesting, we fail to recognize the paramount importance of emotions in human behaviour. To this end, this work explores also the result of painting with machine-like precision vs. performing the artwork with a range of possible imprecisions. The perfection of the machine vs. the imperfection of the human, does it trigger different emotions in us humans? What will the reaction of a machine be whenever they develop a taste?\n\nThis work exposes features that deal with its time and space scales, background colour, background elements, the palettes used, certain colour accents that may happen (golden accents, b&w tones), the style used to draw the geometric shapes (fill, lines, outline), the degree of paint precision and other features that influence the final result. The user may download a PNG file at any arbitrary resolution at any step of the paint process using the commands provided for that. A brief list of commands is as follows. Please note that you need to click on the artwork first to make sure it will receive the typed commands:\n\np to pause/resume the work\nr followed by y to enter the looping mode\nd followed by +/- or any number from 1 to 9 to increase resolution\ns followed by c to save current image\ns+f to automatically save the final image when the system finishes painting\ns+m to restart and save a sequence of images of the process\nr+0 (zero) to reset all parameters and resolutions and restart\nk at any time to define keyframes, then r+0 to restart the work and it will automatically pause at defined steps, or s+i and the work will restart and automatically save an image at every keyframe defined with k. Reload browser to reset.\n\nThere is an Easter egg hidden in every work.\n\nFor the full project description, inspiration and rationale, as well as the full list of features and controls plus a hint at the Easter Egg, please visit the project homepage at https://www.iillucid.com/entretiempos", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_7oB6tc8f3h0CuIoC1NihQSASyHwTdGyuRdB6oquKh8kUVIzSJ3LsPOD-h8-APin2pBaInSzlbvfCucw95TvH1zcjfpywNIaSLU"},

Chaos theory’s most famous tenant, the Butterfly Effect, explains how imperceptible changes in initial conditions can lead to massive and unpredictable differences in outcomes: how a butterfly flapping its wings weeks earlier may lead to a hurricane taking a different course.\n\nWander positions Rhythm & the Machine at the paradox point, building a system that visually suggests both order and chaos, striking a different balance in each composition. Saturated color fields reminiscent of paint moving through water are seemingly randomly distorted and dragged across the canvas. All the while repeating colors and evenly spaced gestures point to an underlying ordered system.\n\nIntuitively you would not expect repeating the same thing over and over would lead to disorder, yet this is exactly what you find with many systems, such as pseudo-random number generators that are foundational to algorithmic generative art.\n\nThrough a reduced system that elevates a few “random” elements—the placement & size of colored geometric shapes, the direction & intensity of the gesture—Rhythm & the Machine introduces distortionary forces that Wander does not dictate nor completely control. Suddenly each cluster of colors takes on a life of its own, creating new forms we cannot predict.\n\nEach work in the collection contains a second ‘instruction’ layer, which maps how the original colored shapes are placed and then distorted. This ‘instruction’ layer reminds us that chaos is in fact rooted in ordered systems. We can see the before and the after of the directional forces, how regular shapes became an abstracted color field. At the same time, the interactions are so complex and layered that trying to anticipate the future is a futile effort. We can try to understand but we cannot predict: a visual articulation of the butterfly effect. This insight is given added weight since the instruction layer is artificial and not a priori to the original digital work, where all of these functions happen simultaneously. The artist constructed it to provide the viewer this unique insight.\n\nWe see the moment of divergence, repeated not just in a single canvas but also across the collection. The wide range of possibilities alludes to infinity—a concept impossible to fully comprehend but in this reduced visual language Wander shows us a piece of it and our minds are able to begin to explore the spread if not the edges.", "imageUrl": "https://meta.tonic.xyz/logo.jpg"},

How some of them are small, fleeting and ephemeral while a select few become lifelong bonds. The work examines the intricate graphs that are formed by these connections. Graphs are all around us and have existed for as long as we have been human. From early settlements of hunter-gatherers and nomadic tribes to the internet of today. It's all graphs.\n\nNära allows the viewer to explore and experience these graphs as a metaphor for the organic, organised chaos that is life. Shapes connect from one node in a graph to the next, sometimes spilling over, doubling down and creating layers of intricacy. Imperfection is embraced and Nära exposes the chaotic and unpredictable elements of life. \n\nThe artistic vision of Nära is to highlight and expose graphs in a tactile manner that allows the viewer to see the whole graph, but also engage with the details and texture.  In doing this, Nära attempts to bring a novel contribution by pushing the boundaries of graph representation and introducing an emotional dimension to this oftentimes rigid and scientific discipline. By treating graphs as a metaphor for relationships in life, they become an integral part of the concept and an important artistic tool. \n\nNära takes inspiration from the De Stijl movement in reducing the world into a deliberate expression in its smallest form and builds upon the use of shapes imbued with meaning in the works of Hilma af Klint. These ideas are expanded on by accepting that what is deliberate must also relinquish some control through the pseudo-randomness of generative art. This invites reflection on the balance of control and chance in our lives. \n\n_Through Nära, you are invited to reflect on the connections in your own life and on the significance of the relationships that define us as human beings._ \n\nTo interact with the script:\n- Press 's' to save.\n- Add the following to the URL:\n  - pd=x, where x is a number to control the resolution via pixel density (useful for rendering high resolution stills)\n  - rs=x, where x is a number to enable and control the rendering buildup animation.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/e806ad9010186cb75e84ae5080a33438.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

Can we converse with creative energy? Artists throughout history have posed such questions. When I start creating new generative artwork, I often focus on discovering what’s new that I might unearth within the exploration of a simple algorithm. When the visual outputs start to move me, I love the idea that perhaps I’ve discovered some sort of personality hidden within the confines of the code, waiting for the most unlikely parameter to unlock its emergent beauty. Within that creative journey, I have a hidden agenda. I hope to commune with the voices hiding inside the code. \n\n*Speak To Me* experiments with layering and interrupting repetitions of basic geometric shapes, exploring their interplay and movement when placed in relation to one another. Drawing loose inspiration from historic art movements such as Suprematism and Constructivism, I’m seeking to investigate the potential of these simple forms to create dynamic and complex visual arrangements. The code generates compositions that are both structured and organic, imparting a movement and energy to the shapes, so they seem to grow and flow like living organisms. Some shapes speak boldly, with clear, directional vision. Some embrace the space between. Within this collection, the differences in those voices are celebrated with intention. \n\nOne night I dreamed of my code in progress, which sometimes happens when I’m immersed in a project. I awoke in the middle of the night with a specific phrase running through my head, got up to groggily scribble it onto some paper, then fell back to sleep. In the morning, I woke up to see the words “Speak To Me”, and I realized that I now had the name of my collection, imparted in a dream.\n\nThroughout the creation of *Speak To Me*, I found myself wondering if there might be a secret life of shapes. Reflecting on the creative process, I firmly believe that there is a dynamic energy inherent in artistic creation that can be considered a life force. As an artist, I view my role as a conduit and facilitator for this energy to manifest in the physical realm. From this perspective, in the case of generative art, I open up the role of creator to share with both the generative randomness of the algorithm and the creative force that inspires its creation.

Understanding yourself and the unlimited variables and actors surrounding us daily requires a radical yet utopian pursuit of objectivity.\n\nA prerequisite to an objective observation is identifying and eliminating cognitive and observational biases.\n\nMy obsession with objectivity started as a sociology student; while studying epistemology of science and pondering the works of Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Karl Popper.\n\nThis quest never left me and has been a cornerstone of my artistic practice for 25 years.\n\n“The map is not the territory” is a mainstream expression highlighting a potentially oversimplified version of reality. In this series called Neural Sediments, inspired by the works of Alberto Burri, František Kupka, and Swiss topography, I highlight the complexity of our brains and some of their biases.\n\nLooking at one Neural Sediment will deliver you a first broad impression; however, looking at it for a longer time will yield a never-ending and much more nuanced and delicate observation. Like Alberto Burri’s Cracks series, some things not obvious to the eye become real over time. Each Neural Sediment opens itself to the viewer in a unique way. The more you look at it, the more you can decipher it. \n\nLike Swiss alpine glacier sediments, this material appears only after a certain amount of time and a decent amount of gravity. Burri used a special technique to envision time with cracked canvas; František Kupka, in his Katedrála painting, opens the fourth dimension by looking at the vertical lines of the glass window.\n\nIn the Neural Sediments series, I used both as an inspiration to push the viewer’s eye to search for more details and a deeper perspective.\n\nChoosing color palettes for a long-form generative art collection is as demanding as solving technical algorithmic challenges. \n\nThe color palettes I create result from a process I've built into my practice over time. Each palette comes from my own algorithmic selection trained on classical masterpieces.\n\nAfter this first selection, each set of colors used in a Neural Sediment is re-arranged to be linked with endangered ecosystems such as dark blue waters, peach salmons, rare botanic species, or volcanos.\n\nLike Josef Albers, who highlighted the instability and deceptiveness of colors, my color sets are here to reinforce the question of objectivity in the art world and life in general.\n\nLooking at its overall structure, each Neural Sediment evokes a brutalist architecture. \n\nPrioritizing function over form, each Neural Sediment aims to be used as a tool to rediscover oneself, free from the cognitive constraints we put on ourselves and the world around us.\n\nPS: From a technical point of view, Neural Sediments require some heavy calculations, considering the very large number of intersections to compute prior to rendering.\n\nPPS: Pressing the letter “i” on your keyboard will generate a high resolution export for a large scale and print friendly format.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/793c723785d65aed7918c9c98ab2372e.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

The project tells a story of the tragic end of all existence in a distant universe, long since forgotten. Any given individual output depicts a passing moment, captured during the final breath of each dying world. The once peaceful landscapes were torn apart, deforming and reshaping their natural geometries and thus the reality itself in a surrealistic fashion.\n\nEach image is drawn to vaguely mimic a pencil-like texture. Firstly to remind of something familiar and subsequently emitting a peculiar and eerie feeling. Did this event happen and was it witnessed by a carbon-based life-form?\n\nThe project invites the viewer to ponder the different scenarios of what might have transpired in the past that lead the universe to its doom. Although one interpretation can be deciphered from the partially corrupted transmission below, it is not necessarily the true explanation.\n\n\nThe only thing that is known, is that all life ceased to exist in this ancient universe long time ago. Its tale lives on, but only as a memory and as a reminder to us all that life can be fragile and fleeting, albeit beautiful and precious.\n\n## The Story\n\n*”If anyone listens .. …. recording …. ….. ….. .. a warning …. …. will happen .. your world. We didn’t …. …. .. our universe, ……. we drained … ….. resource ….. .. couldn’t sustain … life …. any longer. The great collapse .. moments away … this will .. … end .. our story. Do not …… our mistakes. Most importantly … …. prevent ….. …. ……… ….. world .. … ……. ……… at any cost. This is our final transmission.”*\n\nJust as the transmission ends, a sudden flash of dreamlike images flashes through your mind, leaving a vivid imprint. These were the final moments of an ancient, distant and long forgotten universe. The rush is too much to handle and you faint. You wake up and immediately start looking for the recording but it's gone. You remember everything as clear as day, but was it just a dream?\n\n## The Details\n\nThere are several main scenes, which depict the specific stage that the end has advanced to. The predominantly or entirely black and white and the muted palettes give a sense of silence and solitude. Meanwhile other palettes disturb that calmness. Some palettes remind of colors in nature, but most are chosen and used in unnatural manner touching the style of expressionism.\n\nPressing \"s\" saves a screenshot at any point during the rendering.

The name refers to the incense made from sandalwood that is common in Sudan. While sandaliya is the oil of sandalwood used as perfume, Bakhoor Assandal is the incense, burned on coals, made from the same wood. One could say it is the same substance gone up in smoke.\n\nThis project is a continuation of _Sandaliya_, a series that interweaves personal memories and familial connections in Sudan against the growing conflict. In April 2023, a civil war ignited, and many were forced to evacuate. _Bakhoor Assandal_ uses JavaScript and GLSL to create outputs in constant disarray. With a particular focus on movement, the algorithm builds layer by layer, with each pixel in perpetual shift, never replicating its past form –– a testament to life’s relentless change. Like the ephemeral smoke of burning incense, we must embrace the flow, knowing we will remember the scent.\n\n\n**_Notes_**\n\nExperience it in real time: click or press the spacebar to toggle the animation.

The hand selects a metal implement, cuts off a slab of clay, and carves into its surface. It wanders like your hand wanders; it carves imaginary contours, sinuous and exploratory. It doesn’t know the end result so it carves lines until it feels content, and then it numbers the piece and stamps its maker’s mark. It fires the slab in a digital kiln (it calls this “minting”) and through this act its art is preserved for millennia. The hand runs its fingers over the textured surface, feeling satisfaction at having spontaneously produced a piece of art so beautiful, expressive, and unique.\n\n---\n \nCeramics is a generative sculpture that mimics the physical expression of carving into clay. Through uncanny naturalistic rendering it challenges our notion of “handmade”. It asserts that the value of handmade isn’t the time it takes to make the work nor the physical materials consumed, but the endless small decisions and serendipitous details that appear along the way, as can be felt in each Ceramics mint.\n\nDespite the handmade nature of Ceramics the outputs cannot be touched. Highly tactile images enchant the viewer to imagine their tangible representations, and leave them to dwell on their perception of materiality — both in the experiential physical world and conceptually-infinite digital space.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/9de6f9bae207a06ef4091efaa2287504.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

Each year, trees add a new ring to their trunks, recording their growth and responding to the changing seasons and environmental conditions. These rings tell a story of the tree's life. By replicating these patterns, the project captures the rhythmic and organic qualities of nature.\n\nIn this project, I wanted to explore the aesthetic and conceptual possibilities of tree rings through code-based art. I used a generative algorithm to simulate the growth of virtual trees, generating patterns that resemble the annual rings of real trees, but with a twist. Instead of using traditional circular or oval shapes, I experimented with different geometric forms and noise. I also played with colors and instead of using earthy and realistic colours, the palettes are inspired by the richness and diversity of the natural world.\n\nThe algorithm works by starting with the outer most ring, which over time grows towards an arbitrary chose center according to certain rules and parameters. Each iteration adds a new layer of shapes inside the previous one, mimicking the accumulation of tree rings. I introduced random mutations and variations, which introduce unexpected and unpredictable outputs, evoking the unpredictability of natural processes.\n\nEach artwork is inviting the viewer to contemplate the complexity and diversity of nature. I hope that this project will inspire others to explore the wonders of nature and to experiment with code-based art as a means of expression and exploration.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/62be5f1e594a61d0fbc7414d425b16a2.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

Over the 25 years of her artistic career, LIA's working process has typically involved as much intuition as it does engineering skill, and this piece is no exception. Growing from an initial Processing sketch by way of the artist's careful selection of angles, transparencies, and line weights, a virtually infinite sequence of house-like forms appears and disappears. LIA conceives of her practise as a conversation between her own fluid concepts and the formal precision required of software code; when accidents or bugs appear, they are often treated as a part of this conversation and incorporated into the final work. In this piece the “cheeky blue” and “cheeky red” features arise from a bug in calculating the colour spread, and have been retained for their aesthetic contribution to the images. Taking inspiration from the song “Little Boxes” by Malvina Reynolds, this piece is a contemplation of houses and cities. The cyclical relationship between the construction of homes, the lands and environments they have replaced, and the ecosystems that will eventually replace them is echoed through an infinite production of geometric compositions. “little boxes on the hillsides, child” is the successor of “little boxes on the hillsides, mother”, presented in the exhibition “Synthetic Imagination” at bitforms gallery San Francisco, October 2–November 15, 2021. The NFTs minted on Art Blocks are the children of the “mother” work: brilliantly colourful, they are rendered in stillness as an artifact of the mother program's generative output, whose ancestry can be activated on the Art Blocks website by pressing the 'a' key to reveal the animated process behind the production of the still image.

Witnessing the vast fields of yuccas flowering simultaneously and watching the sunrise over Judd's 100 untitled works in mill aluminum are two specific moments that will never leave my memory. Combining these two sensations resulted in generative arrangements of yuccas and boxes.\n## Edge of the desert\nThe city of Marfa is on the northeast side of the Chihuahuan desert. The weather is dry and hot in the summer. Plants that grow naturally in the region, like the yucca, have adapted well to the harsh conditions.\n## Soaptrees\nIn the Americas, there are a lot of different types of yucca. The type of yucca that grows in and around Marfa is called yucca elata, which is also known as the soaptree yucca. These yuccas grow very slowly, only about an inch per year. Yucca elata doesn't always bloom, but when it does, the flowers come out between May and June.\n## Sunrise at Chinati\nThe Chinati Foundation is a museum in Marfa based on Donald Judd's ideas. The focus is on works that have a strong connection to the land around them. Sometimes a special event called \"Sunrise at Chinati\" is held at the museum so that people can see the many works in the golden light of the morning sun.\n# An SVG is available!\nThe SVG is a fully scalable resolution agnostic version of the image.

They are used widely in architecture, product design, and perhaps most familiarly in user interfaces. Think: desktop icons like trash cans or notepads. SKEUOMORPHS is a meditation on this digital tradition. \n\nSKEUOMORPHS picks up where RASTER left off as an another exploration of the materiality of pixels and rasterized imagery. Here the study of pixels narrows in on the shallow depth of on-screen interfaces and the play of low-res figure-ground effects. Moments of skeuomorphism where the 2-dimensional plane of the screen becomes slightly 3-dimensional through beveling or drop-shadows are extracted and used as abstract painterly details. These elements that are typically used to make computation and interfaces more familiar become unfamiliar on the canvas, suggesting the possibility of an aesthetic between abstraction and realism.\n\nSKEUOMORPHS employs recurring themes and techniques from my art practice: limited color palettes, low-res chunky pixels, dithering, and physics simulation. It uses a specific kind of dithering called R-sequence dither developed by Martin Roberts. Like traditional Bayer matrix-based dithering, this technique produces a patterned image akin to retro video games and early computer screens. In this project, the R-dither pattern results in a woven textile-like texture, which recalls the long relationship between computing and weaving. The canvas negotiates two scales simultaneously: that of the dithered pixel (rendered at 1/1024th of the canvas height) and the simulated particle that acts as a brush stroke (rendered at 1/256th of the canvas height). The two resolutions work together to produce a cohesive texture that is neither pretending to be a retrograde screen nor an analog material but something in between. Similar to RASTER, the goal is to investigate new avenues for digital aesthetics that rely on a combination of historical techniques and innovative practices.\n\nUse mouse or touch controls to interact.\nPress 's' to grab a still frame.\n\nCollectors will be eligible to receive a signed archival giclée print of their mint.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2KwF-XnOMvzoC83O9HFJ48h5z0TlCaRJ33raDUPX47a58rw4AdHucVJJjX5k2GVC3HbfadtTndcWbXxGLTo2L5g8o-RByKG3Gg"},

Through sprawling images of densely populated urban landscapes and human gatherings, the collection reduces individuals to minuscule points, forming an overwhelming sea of indistinguishable dots.\n\nBeyond the literal portrayal of overpopulation, this collection utilizes the metaphor of crowd density as an analogy for the inundation of information in our modern era.

These elements form reaction fields, colonies, flocks, oceans, rivers, forests, mountains, clouds, earth, and stars and galaxies scattered throughout the universe. They exist in countless numbers at each scale, and their interactions cannot be ignored. Chemical, physical, and biological interactions occur, resulting in complex phenomena. These phenomena are stirred, collided, reacted, collapsed, extinguished, and multiplied by flows.\n\nSimilarly, in the social and mental constructs humans create, such as cities, organizations, societal and economic networks, information on the internet, cultural values, languages, thoughts, and emotions, there exists a similar interplay, leading to complex dynamics.\n\nFluctuations exist on all scales.\n\nEven seemingly stable phenomena are constantly fluctuating and in flux when viewed on different scales of time or space, and there is no such thing as an unchanging situation. Each element is as small as a grain of sand when viewed as a whole, and no single element alone affects the whole, but is swallowed up by the larger current and fleetingly disappears with a momentary emission of color.\n\nI feel that the lifespan of an individual is also like this.\n\n\nSubtle alterations and flows are interwoven into everything around us, possessing an unpredictably influential nature. However, this fluctuation can be an opportunity to find beauty and meaning in the uncertainty and chaos of our reality.\n\n-------------\n\nAfter pressing the \"open\" button on the fxhash project page to open the window, press the \"F\" key to view it in full screen mode.

By referencing historical precedents, Flourish produces designs that exist between the past and present, striking a balance between tradition and innovation.\n\nFlourish’s logic uses a linguistic structure that treats simple shapes like an alphabet and arranges geometry into phrases, establishing and dissolving symmetries. This logic is similar to a formal grammar system with rules that describe how words can be combined to form sentences. As a very simple example, a rule for the English language might be that a noun phrase can be followed by a verb phrase. So, a person dances, a cat sleeps, a bird sings. In the context of Flourish, pentagons can be subdivided into triangles, which can be enclosed by circles to create complex patterns. As geometry is combined and rearranged, the linguistic-like structure of the image changes, which also changes the next possible sets of geometric operations.\n\nThe palettes reflect various eras and mediums, invoking the feeling of aged archival drawings, woodblock prints, freshly inked illustrations, blueprints, and photocopies. The images resemble photographs of drawings rather than the drawings themselves, creating the impression of a carefully archived collection of artifacts that document a history just now coming into existence.\n\nIn my own history, I spent many years filling notebooks with abstract flowing drawings using very fine pens while studying painting and drawing. I would start by making one small curved mark, and then make thousands more while following the natural rhythm that my hand and wrist made. The density of marks and careful variations of spacing gave the drawings a meditative quality. Flourish's fine flowing lines draw from this meditative practice, imbuing each image with a sense of careful attention and intention.\n\nThe best architecture is a harmony of the natural and the constructed. And so the fine detailed marks are meant to feel natural, and to build up the constructed geometries with an emergent natural foundation.\n\nManipulating the arrangement of primary shapes to create complex patterns is a hallmark of both generative design and traditional architectural design. Flourish exists somewhere between this relationship. Rather than taking the historical path of contemporary parametric architecture, with its large sweeping forms and sci-fi aesthetics, Flourish creates an alternative history, a revivalist rebirth of the roaring twenties for the 2020s.\n\n------\nPrints on archival paper will be made available at a later date.\n\nA percentage of profits from the primary sale will be donated to the Hawaii Community Foundation's Maui Strong Fund to support Maui residents affected by the wildfires.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/79a613560bd2b8f8976e0aa50ccfa150.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

Iggy was on 100% from the moment we started and we just had fun together. We shot for 1 hour, no break, a staccato of poses and expressions, before his girlfriend came to pick him up for a Halloween Party. When the portrait of the smiling Iggy came out it had an immediate impact on my career. People were requesting the Iggy Pop light and I went on to photograph many legends in the same light.

The idea is simple. You start with a string of nodes connected to one another to form a shape. Each node feels 3 forces:\n - A repulsion force from all other nodes\n - An attraction force towards its immediate neighbors\n - An attraction force towards the midpoint between its neighbors\n\nAs you add more nodes into the shape, these 3 rules cause the shape to curve into itself, growing into a complex form of layered undulating lines. The goal is to create a shape that fills as much space as possible while maintaining a rigid form and avoiding overlapping itself. By focusing specifically on where and when you add more nodes, and how you interpret those nodes into a shape, there is much variety to be found in this simple algorithm.\n\nSince I first learned about this technique, and wrote my own version based off these rules, I have been continuing to iterate, evolve, and optimize my code. It's an algorithm I always find myself coming back to, and has become my most researched topic and longest running experiment. I love its use of real life physics, and I find its outputs aesthetically pleasing on a deeper, almost instinctual level. \n\nEach output of 'Spaghetti Bones' starts with a simple shape as a seed for the differential growth algorithm. Throughout the rendering process, the shape is fed more nodes, and grows until it cannot find any empty space to fill. As it grows, a form is interpreted from the nodes of the growth and drawn onto the screen, creating a snapshot of the growth at that particular moment. There are many rules that govern how the shape grows, and how its form is interpreted, and these rules often evolve throughout the rendering process. When the render is complete, the resulting image is a full catalog of the history of the shape's life. \n\nThe name of this project was created by Nicole, my girlfriend and an art wizard. Early on in the development of this project, I asked her to name an output I was sharing, and she chose to call it ‘Spaghetti Bones’ because that’s what it looked like. Since then, the name has stuck with me. I decided to keep the name for the final project in order to highlight the playfulness of each output, to encourage imagination when viewing this abstract art, and to thank Nicole for being tremendously supportive and helpful throughout my exploration of the art world.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/c8DbQviFttlTfW3gM57CU83Q1RefgHcYcjqXLS8O85kRKfktwfLWgvRJ6_Lw9tfjKqObxpDLkGajsd8eqEcLQoeVrpcMOW2_VF4"},

The work emphasizes uncovering the deeper aspects of our relationships and suggesting that genuine, meaningful connection can only be fully experienced when the veil of surface appearances is lifted.\n\nBuilding a relationship is often considered a process of construction, where two individuals come together to form a bond. However, the process can also be seen as deconstruction, where both partners must tear down the walls they have built around themselves, exposing their vulnerabilities and allowing themselves to be known.\n\nContiero's works feature open fields of color that melt together to create an effect reminiscent of marbling. Vibrant hues are subtly aged with a patina, enhancing each piece's visual impact and giving it a sense of depth and movement. Through Contiero's striking compositions, he invites us to consider the role physical and emotional obstacles play in shaping our experiences of intimacy. Only through time and deep exploration can these barriers be removed.", "imageUrl": "https://meta.tonic.xyz/logo.jpg"},

The artist was spending those days creating artwork for what became Async Art's very first programmable artwork, \"First Supper.\" Among his creative contributions to this artwork including his greenish skinned \"Visionary Spirit of Creation,\" Kane collaborated with fellow artist Mlibty on assets for \"I AM THE TABLE,\" an NFT that Kane claims to still possess. Kane explains, \"This particular design went unminted because collaborating with Alotta Money made me extremely insecure about my own Adobe Photoshop skills. Mine were pebbles to his mountain. We were just getting to know one another through the process of this collaboration. In the Discord, I shared my dank design of stacked ETH coins, and asked if anyone with better Photoshop skills wanted to collab on the legs. I didn't directly ask him, not wanting to burden him as I knew he was very busy with CryptoVoxel commissions. My lapse to ask became all the more silly as we became fast friends as the First Supper collaboration continued. With no volunteers, I decided to leave that extra design out of the original table NFT for First Supper. Three years later, when Conlan and Nate reached out to me and explained the concept of Forever Supper, I instantly thought of this unminted table. I've always regretted not including this design in the original table NFT, but as I've come to learn in life, time tends to reveal greater purpose for our pasts.\"\n\nMINTING THE UNMINTED: 128 variations represent the 128 coins in the original unminted table design: 32 ETH stacked in each leg to represent the required amount to stake a node on the Ethereum blockchain. Like a table, staking is to become the solid foundation on which everyone working on the Ethereum blockchain depends on. It's my hope that that the artwork's variations become ways for collectors to represent their own values as they trade and update their Forever Supper cores to reflect their sentiment toward Ethereum and the market at any given time.\"\n\nGENERATIVE: \"I wrote an algorithm in Processing to stack the coins which make up the legs of the table. Using the concept of the Fear & Greed Index, 50 is the most stable. 0 being the most fearful contains the greatest weaknesses in the structure. 100, being the most greedy has the coins wobbling, almost dancing as greed threatens to unstake the coins to be cashed in. In order to create the unique cover art for each variation, I repurposed an algorithm I was originally working with in early 2020 that I created to test the limits of Async Art in those early days. On a whole, this is a loving tribute to a period of time that has grown to carry meaning into the future for a global audience, as we all continue building and learning.\"\n\nThis is an Expansion Pack for Forever Supper, the biggest cryptoart collaboration.

At times, one can experience their private, most expansive self as their true self. In other moments, a performative cutout is needed to conform to one’s environment. Through its various manifestations, the work dwells on the tension between displaying the private self as a form of liberation, and amplifying the performative self as a form of suppression.\n\nThe collection draws inspiration from my childhood as an Indian-American growing up in Atlanta, where I felt pressure to conform to the cultural norms and expectations of those around me. This nurtured conflicting perceptions of my public and private identify – a dilemma depicted in Semblance through a reimagination of the weavings and textiles from my childhood home.\n\nEach Semblance is a unique blend of color, diffusion, and environment. Its appearance is shaped by the suppression of a distinct focal point that dictates its context. Ultimately, the viewer is invited to toggle between the two states and explore that tension within themselves.\n\n**–– Controls ––**\n\n– **Press ‘m’** or **click/tap** to toggle between the selves.

I wonder how we got here from those rainy springs and where we will go. The heat’s visible haze makes me doubt the possibility of future Augusts spent outdoors. It is in this haze that *chaos comes with the summer haze* takes form. \n\nMy inspiration is from both beauty and fear - the beauty of the land, the water, the flowers, the beauty of paint and code, the beauty of humanity – the fear of panic and mob mentalities, the fear of incongruity and environmental collapse, the fear of humankind. It is from the obsessiveness, visual overload, content overload, and our aching yet hopeful eyes as we stare towards the horizon.\n\n*chaos comes with the summer haze* is specifically aligned with my art practice, which for decades has attempted to address technology, climate change, human irrationality and human rights, while being unencumbered by limitations of medium. Whether it is dragging paintings in the ocean, writing a new constitution, or encoding this Project, all have the same goal - creating impressions that are pleasing while acting as guideposts or warnings. Here, I’ve ratcheted up the intensity of everything. The breadth of coloration, brushstrokes and variety of possible outputs push dramatically in a way only possible through the generative process. Many times, I feel the code taking over the composition with the intent of heightening the chaos itself, perhaps adding an exclamation point to the warning therein.\n\nVisually, it is symptomatic of both human and earthly chaos. The earthly ‘gestalts’ are the seas rising and the clouds gathering. The ‘meltdowns’ are the human brushstrokes that feel panicked, despite being controlled. They are haphazard, geometric and duplicative. They obscure reality. The handpicked colors touch the rainbow of possibilities, but are affected by that summer haze. The ‘shadow frequency’ demonstrates content overload, duplication and machine learning, all creating further feelings of distress.  There are layers and layers of possibilities – of coffee stains, of visual heat, of faces, of ideas, of dimensional portals, of the future...\n\n*The Rising Edition* \n\nThe first 46 minters (tokens #1-46) will receive *The Rising Edition* physical collection as a gift, which includes:\n\n* A unique print of the minter’s piece, printed on archival Hahnemühle German etching paper, mounted on 16” x 12” (40.6 cm x 30.5 cm) varnished maple board, signed and titled on verso. \n\n* A sculpture featuring a porcelain blanketed rock - discovered, shaped and fired by the Artist. \n\n* A limited edition hardcover, linen wrapped visual compendium chronicling the conceptual theory and production of the work, signed and numbered.\n\nPlease visit the Project’s website for images of the Rising Edition and further details on the Project.\n\n*Controls*\n\np - for a high resolution (6000 x 7200 pixels) printable version \ns - to save the image as a png file", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/00f96e3c25fb79a1d922c14132b3c2bd.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

Beyond technology ::**\n\nImagine a world where technology not only advances mechanically, but also adapts and changes in response to its environment. \n\nIn this view, machines could evolve into a variety of forms, from biological and organic to architectural and industrial, each with its own unique capabilities and characteristics.\n\nThe UMK algorithm could be thought of as a life form that has evolved from a seed. Its DNA defines the way in which it grows and develops.\n\n**:: Motivation ::**\n\nUMK expands my previous explorations of the interaction between humans and technology. \n\nPreviously, In the \"Defrag Trilogy\" (link in the website), I narrate a tale spanning three chapters, exploring the emotions we encounter as we mature amidst a technologically world. The conclusion: technology emerges victorious every time.\n\nThis time, I delve into the idea of a world where human intervention is not necessary, showcasing a hypothetical scenario where machines operate and evolve independently. What would self-evolving technology look like?\n\n**:: Aesthetics ::**\n\nAs a devout admirer of Manga and graphic novels, the style of the artwork is centered around creating a hand-drawn, captivating one-page masterpiece. \n\nWith UMK, I embark on a journey of maximalist illustration. A path that pushes the boundaries of my previous creations to achieve  figurative pieces that are both visually stunning and unpredictably intriguing.\n \nThis maximalist approach is designed to evoke a sense of wonder and exploration. The intricate use of textures and interlocking geometries invites the viewer to dive into the artwork and be entranced by the details and nuances. \n\n**:: Animation ::**\n\nAnimation is crafted to captivate and hold the viewer's attention. Sit back and savor the mesmerizing construction mechanics and the gentle flow of the subtle elements in the background.\n\n**:: Final words ::**\n\nIn UMK there is a touch of the clean and dreamlike drawing of Jean Giraud (Moebius), the intricate technological structures of Katsuhiro Otomo, or the biomechanical orgies of H.R. Giger. These are some examples of artists who have left a lasting impression on me and whose works continue to shape my aesthetic sensibility.\n\nArt lies within the code itself. When we view the outcome on the screen, we are witnessing the crystallization of the algorithm at a specific moment, under certain conditions. The code is immutable and the results are mere coincidence. \n\nEnjoy UMK.\n\n**:: Interaction ::**\n\nYou can restart the animation or save it as a hi resolution PNG image.\nTap the screen or mouse click to show the reset/save buttons.\nAlso you can use keys: 'S' to save , 'R' to restart", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5SKrVedRtuZdIku3hHJHqqz1exrGzRi_uvTYHdoc3L4YGWgGF6isAXFe_exkriUN2Bz8ennrdjX9OZpbBXpHf1yYlQttevPXsS4"},

Both contemplation and meditation have proven to have a positive impact on improving mental and physical health.  \n\nConsciousness, Healing arts, and spirituality, Fushi No Reality is a window through surrealities. A procedural immortal healing ritual unlocking our capacity to cure ourselves.  \n\nEach surreality is forged from a real-time organic system running in an infinite and perpetual movement, crafted from chaos and noise-domain explorations. From a computing point of view, there is no distinction between visually random noise and mastered noise. They are both an output of the same algorithm perceived by our brain as a signal. From a soul point of view, the difference is the perception and what we, humans, do qualify as pleasing, perceptible, or intriguing.\n\nExploration, observation, and modulation are key to this vast pandemonium of chaos. A creative process to re-forge shapes we already observe in our world’s best inspiration: Nature.\n\nThis inspiration directed Fushi No reality towards Landscape art/cloth art mixed with vaporware aesthetics, slow movement, and peaceful color palettes.  A light beam travels through each surreality to guide a few voyaging spirits across the landscape. Portrait or landscape,  the surrealities are meant to be displayed in both ways, viewers may look at generative cloth swirling and sci-fi planetary landscapes.  \n\nThe more adventurous may move their cursor to the top or bottom to live a faster healing experience.\n\nNo one can bring you peace but yourself, but this time, let’s travel together.\n\nフシハ、セイカツノナカデスローダウンスルテダスケガヒツヨウカモシレナイヒト、シコウ二マヨッテシマウヒト、タチアガルタメノフォーカスポイントガヒツヨウナヒトノタメノシュウチュウリョクガクシュウデス。\n\n[Fushi no reality / フシノゲンジツ]ハ、シサクへノショウタイジョウデス。\nワタシタチノカンジョウレベルヲサポートスルヤクワリヲハタシ、メイソウジョウタイヘトミチビクコトデ、ワタシタチノカンキョウヲヨリイイモノ二スルコトヲモクテキトシテイマス。メイソウトジュクコウハドチラモ、シンシンノケンコウゾウシン二イイエイキョウヲアタエルコトガショウメイサレテイマス。\n\nイシキ、ヒーリングアート、スピリチュアリティ、フシギノリアリティハチョウゲンジツヲトウシテノマドデス。フメツノイヤシノギシキハ、ワタシタチジシンノチユノウリョクヲトキハナツタメノテズクリデス。\n \nソレゾレノチョウゲンジツハ、カオストノイズリョウイキノタンキュカラツクラレタ、ムゲンカツエイゾクテキナハタラキデハタラクリアルタイムノユウキテキナシステムカラツクラレテイマス。コンピューティングノカンテンカラハ、シカクテキ二ランダムナノイズトマスタリングサレタノイズノアイダニクベツハナイ。ドチラモ、ワタシタチノノウガシンゴウトシテニンシキスルオナジアルゴリズムノシュツリョクデアル。タマシイノカンテンカラハ、ソノチガイハチカクノチガイデアリ、ワタシタチニンゲンガナニヲモッテ「タノシイ」「チカクデキル」「キョウミヲソソラレル」トハンダンスルカトイウコトデス。\n\nコノコウダイナカオスノパンデモニウム二ハ、タンサク、カンサツ、ソシテモジュレーションガジュウヨウナカギトナリマス。コノセカイサイコウノインスピレーションノナカデ、ワタシタチガスデニカンサツシテルカタチヲサイケイセイスルタメノソウゾウテキナプロセス。シゼン。\n\nコノインスピレーションハ、[Fushi no reality / フシノゲンジツ]ヲ、ジョウキセンノビガク、ユックリトシタハタラキ、オダヤカナシキチョウヲマゼタフウケイガヤクロスアートニムカワセマシタ。コウセンハソレゾレノチョウゲンジツヲトオリヌケ、フウケイヲヨコギルスウジンノコウカイタマシイヲミチビキマス。ポートレートヤフウケイナド、チョウゲンジツハリョウホウノホウホウデテンジサレルコトヲイトシテアリ、カンショウシャハジェネレーティブナヌノノウズマキヤSFテキナワクセイノフウケイヲナガメルコトガデキマス。\n\nヨリボウケンテキナヒトハ、カーソルノウエカシタカニハタラカシテ、ヨリハヤイイヤシノタイケンヲスルコトモデキマス。\nヘイワヲモタラスノハジブンジシンダケデスガ、コンカイハイッショニタビヲシテミマショウ。", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EryURhZJmiPjV6-s--np__2JSBmuJyyTwiQocrQJwMrwl5GBVtjewczyj7OT00nOiYxTa8g4gttRcBTXtu5a6PCc76OGcLf8Lg"},

In addition to playing a crucial role in the growth and reproduction of fungi, it also seems to interweave with nature at large.\n\n*Mycelia* takes place in a similar domain to my previous works centered around the connection between math, music, art, and nature. What can we learn from nature's generative processes, and how could these be used in a digital environment? It is fascinating how something that seems to be such a simple algorithm can achieve such tremendous results.\n\n#### The Algorithm\nIn a similar way to the mycelium we find in nature, my virtual mycelia grows by extending its hyphae, absorbing nutrients, and breaking them down into energy. As the mycelium grows and matures, it forms a network of interconnected hyphae.\n\nIn a simplified way, every hypha has a core algorithm with the following instructions:\n1. Absorb nutrition from the soil and convert it into energy.\n2. Use the energy to move one step forward. Does the new position contain more of the nutrition it needs? If yes, repeat step 1, otherwise go to step 3.\n3. Divide into two new hyphae growing slightly to the left and right to increase the chance to find more nutrition.\n\nOn top of the core algorithm, a few other things could happen:\n\n- There are different kinds of nutrients. A hypha can only focus on one kind at a time. But if it travels long distances, its DNA can change to absorb another kind of nutrient. This opens up more complicated networks and surprising outcomes.\n- The angle used when a hypha divides could sometimes change to be wider or narrower, always with the goal of optimizing the nutrient intake.\n- When the hypha collides with another branch in the network, they grow together. But there is also a chance that it could cross a branch depending on the difference in age between the branches. Think of it like it grows slightly up or down, which makes it possible to pass over or under a branch.\n- There is a survival mechanism that is triggered when only a few hyphae exist in the network, which can force it to cross its own branches.\n\n\nA challenge with the project was how to achieve an aesthetic outcome that could please the eye. The solution was to find a way to generate the amount and position of nutrients in the ground. Influenced by how sound spreads through the air, the nutrients spread from a single point and are being pushed out in wave-shaped circles over time. The waves are built synthetically by mixing sine waves with different frequencies and amplitudes.

However, as soon as the artist (or anyone in his family) drops something at home, one of the stacks topples through an on-chain event. Through the on-chain event the artist will share an image of what was dropped, and its aftermath — was it a cup of tea, perhaps a plate full of food? Most Accidents Happen at Home is positioned as a way to be a bit more mindful about keeping track of things and for the artist do his very best to not accidentally drop things at home.\n\nView the Collection: [Most Accidents Happen at Home](https://wild.xyz/jonas-lund/most-accidents-happen-at-home/)\n\nAbout the Artist: [Jonas Lund](https://wild.xyz/jonas-lund/)\n\nFollow Jonas: [@Jonas_Lund](https://twitter.com/jonas_lund)\n\nFollow Wild: [@wildxyz](https://twitter.com/wildxyz)", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/a0f116aad04feaed7e606931afdb0a60.png?w=500&auto=format"},

As the layers all possess some level of transparency, light passes through the paint, hitting the canvas and reflecting back toward the viewer. This creates an otherworldly, glowing, living effect that is inimitable by any other means. The nature of the technique requires a tremendous amount of time--the more glazes, the more rich and beautiful the effect--and is very unforgiving of mistakes. The artist that dedicates to this slow, careful, path--to return, again and again, layer after layer, week after week--will bring a rare and singular beauty into the world.\r\n\r\n*This collection features an Open Edition, a 24-hour [1/1 Auction](https://www.niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x464436fa5a31b0923922d56d6e755e53927260b6/1), a [100 edition FCFS](https://www.niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x464436fa5a31b0923922d56d6e755e53927260b6/2) (for previous collectors only), and an exclusive [airdrop](https://www.niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x464436fa5a31b0923922d56d6e755e53927260b6/3) (for Claire Silver's 1/1 holders).

I vividly recall a childhood trek up Mt. Fuji with my parents through a foggy bamboo forest, and the image of my dad buying a walking stick from an older vendor. But as my mom later clarified, the adventure actually took place in a Tokyo park –– I’ve never even visited Fuji-san. Contemplating this blend of the real and the imagined has led me to create generative vistas whose clarity is eroded by the passing of time.\n\n\nThe landscapes in Recollection are understated and familiar: rolling hills, distant mountains, and sporadic clusters of trees or forests. There is a path through grass and stone –– sometimes clear but, at other times, overgrown and obscure. Many of these paths culminate at a portal, its purpose enigmatic. It is pure mystery, both inviting and unsettling. It is an obscuring void, a memory half-recalled.\n\nRecollection is a meditation on the mysteries of the mind, and a tribute to the quest for understanding. It stands not only as a beacon of hope for those grappling with the disintegration of memory, but also a testament to the enduring pursuit of clarity in the midst of obscurity. While some details may fade with time, the essence — the emotions, the lessons, the significance — has the potential to regenerate through reflection, conversation, and creative expression.\n\n\nRecollection is part of the reGEN initiative for Alzheimer’s research. For many, this cause is deeply personal and, I believe, it is no exaggeration to say that almost everyone has witnessed the effects of Alzheimer’s, be it within their own family or through friends. This project not only creates funding but also plays a pivotal role in amplifying awareness about Alzheimer’s disease. The opportunity to merge the joy of artistic expression with a mission that has tangible, real-world implications is profoundly inspiring.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IH7KqvVHOs7tKl6mKuY_yabviieEPAC8EiMkDljOg2lpZsjkMoZlfSE7vascFa1kc2r6Cm1iuyHZlp95T6jMp2pVOHY7EnHmTgY"},

As various forces influence more than 500,000 particles in real time, a dynamic “stardust sculpture” emerges, each reflecting a spirit’s unique personality through forms such as swirling currents, dancing flames, glowing filaments, and neural pathways.\n\nBuilding upon the use of organic form in *Bubble Blobby*, evocative color in *Glow*, and meditative motion in *Light Beams*, *Worlds Within* additionally simulates simple yet beautiful phenomena in the natural world like gravitation and chromatic aberration to reveal how hidden forces on the micro scale affect the whole in surprising ways.\n\n*Worlds Within* is inspired by Cai Guo-Qiang's pyrotechnics, Thomas Wilfred's kinetic light art, and outer space phenomena. Drawing on these influences to create a unique visual aesthetic, *Worlds Within* gives the viewer a glimpse of the intangible: the stark black background disorients the viewer's perception of setting, scale, and dimension—much like James Turrell’s immersive light works—and draws attention to the center of the frame, where something mysterious and beautiful emerges.\n\n#### Shortcuts\n* **q:** toggle quality to lower resolution (default is high)\n* **m:** toggle rendering mode to time-based rendering, some frames may be skipped (default is frame-based rendering, every frame is rendered)\n* **mouse click + drag:** rotate view\n* **spacebar:** pause/resume\n* **s:** save screenshot\n\nNote: requires a WebGL2-enabled browser and a decent GPU.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Nba4lbgtlGC6JB8k5EkWbp0aVIPcjZAY5yRS-dKRAe5cCP1Qrq8KiKnq19Y_F80KHGr2VhoEFdvy-SfG9a94O8okUa2b4ZuMmQc"},

On their journey, shapes cross over one another while occasionally encountering loops, beams, and numbered asteroids.\n \nFrom the earliest sketches, questions emerged: Where are they going? Who are they? Will their fall or race ever end? Where is the finish line? Or as Italo Calvino’s character Qfwfq, in the story The Form of Space, while falling, assuming he is falling, occasionally moving in an upward direction, maybe just flowing along an unknown path in the space without above and below, wonders if his trajectory will intersect with his love-longing in the future. On this never-ending fall, passing by one or many universes revolving around them, he contemplates all the positive and negative outcomes, dreaming of their parallels eventually meeting:\n\n“In this alternation of hopes and apprehensions, I continued to fall, constantly peering into the depths of space to see if anything heralded an immediate or future change in our condition. A couple of times I managed to glimpse a universe, but it was far away and seemed very tiny, well off to the right or to the left; I barely had time to make out a certain number of galaxies like shining little dots collected into superimposed masses which revolved with a faint buzz, when everything would vanish as it had appeared, upwards or to one side, so that I began to suspect it had only been a momentary glare in my eyes.\n\n […] unwound in continuous, parallel, straight lines which mean nothing beyond themselves in their constant flow, never meeting, just as we never meet in our constant fall […]”\n\nTo all on unknown latitudes, exploring forms of the space.\n\n-------------\nControls: \n\n[p] key or click/tap for pause/play animation\n\n[a] turn auto rotate on/off\n\n[n] rotate view clockwise\n\n\n-------------\nMade with p5.js and chroma.js. \n\n-------------\nMinting 3 tokens at a time will generate a series of Latitudes in all 3 possible directions in the same color palette. \n\n\n\n\n", "imageUrl": "https://arweave.net/ccG1ZTwT6OA07taSQVzFRZoPTr8XRPJRs68aX4T1NWE"},

It explores the relationship between art, code and nature. - \"Becoming the Mountains and Rivers\". \nThe series explores the mythic idea of a time that came before, when we were one with nature and ourselves. This landscape refuses to hold still. Instead, the viewer is asked to contemplate about being the constant in this ever changing space. They are the only thing that can create a true moment in an otherwise fluid and dynamic world. The piece invites viewers to become fully immersed in the landscape, to contemplate their own inner zen and to feel a sense of calm and peace as they watch the land, water, and sky move and flow. It is an invitation to appreciate the beauty of nature and to reflect on the endless yearning for completeness that we all experience at some point in our lives. Like a postcard that transports us to another time, or a memory that provokes feelings of longing and missing, \"Longing\" invites us to reconnect with ourselves and to find peace in the ever-flowing river of life in the current moment.\n\nThe piece uses generative code to create a space where one can appreciate the beauty of nature while gaining a new perspective on how we perceive art. Instead of presenting viewers with the conventional form of a painting’s static view-through-the-window, Longing takes viewers into a living and breathing artwork. Just as nature moves in patterns that we know how to anticipate but can’t predict, Longing also moves in ever-evolving patterns that are both comforting and surprising. In this way, Longing challenges the static nature of painting while testing out where digital art can take us—is this a form of art that is in sync with nature? Or does it take us further away by inserting additional layers of mediation? Longing does not answer these questions, but it helps us contemplate possible responses, and pushes us to reconsider the nature and purpose of art in the 21st century.\n\nTechnical details\nImmersive~ The artwork would fit any format ratio and resolution, hit full screen to widen the view and experience the work in landscape formats.\n\nEvolving~ Movement: Time lapse after draw starting at the featured time and transitioning to the local time of the work, when local time is settled the work will display the current time and evolve the sky with it.

The piece revolves around the idea of duality. It's both serious and childish. It plays on the contrast between the very crowded slum and the emptiness of the void it seems to float in. Bidonville talks about life and death, and the promiscuity between both in those wild and teeming areas.

Starting with Clubhouse in 2021, we forged friendships during the pandemic. As the world re-opened, our journey continued to events nationwide. I shared my art with Frens at each place through drawings and live paintings.   Last fall, we built a vibrant and supportive community with my project, The Stoics.

The Bauhaus design movement started in the early 20th century by Walter Gropius. Bauhaus art and design is recognized by its unique approach to architecture and design noted especially for a program that synthesizes technology, craftsmanship, and design aesthetics. The Bauhaus style is recognized by it's simplicity, pure lines, and geometric shapes, combined with primary-colored chromatic palettes. \n\nExhibit 3291 (E.3291) humbly and with honor continues in this timeless tradition. Each mint embraces “ little ornamentation and focuses on balanced forms and abstract shapes ', Exhibit 3291 takes its cue from the classic 1923 Bauhaus Exhibition poster. Using this composition as a template, E.3291 generates unique pieces of art steeped in the Bauhaus tradition. Each E.3291 has a color scheme and variations on the template, including additional lines, shapes and outlines. \n\nIt is my hope that as a collector you feel part of this historic art and design movement.\n\nTo request a print, please visit https://www.cryptobauhaus.com/exhibit-3291", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/o2CVpPrD1kjbTQGZUEXfPHcIgfsUjO3d8ram11bQTWhD-qjjg8XE_csSVC0VJhgG0oigOhaKi0NngoHXlwVEM-QV9bdnLwgxLHg"},

There was just enough depth to each compartment for room to place a miniature trinket. It was filled with all kinds of knickknacks that we often picked up from the local mall. Some of the tchotchkes would tie into our lives, but many were just fun pieces, and the overall make up of the miniature box (as we called it) became an evolving composition.\n\nThis work, Gewgaw, tries to recreate that miniature box, dividing the canvas into small compartments of various sizes and orientations. Each block contains a looping animation, from one of 16 different styles. Many outputs will focus on just one or two styles, while others will incorporate all 16. Each style has its own set of parameters to provide variety within each block. In the end, the dozens, or hundreds, of animation blocks all come together to create an overall unique and lively composition.\n\nThere are 15 palettes of varying likelihood to show up across the 200 outputs, but two in particular are special for this project. The Silver Ticket and Golden Ticket palettes will be used to provide access to a free mint (gas and fees still apply, of course) in an upcoming long-form animated generative art project. The upcoming work, Digital Bath, will be published on Highlight, and Silver Palette holders will receive 1 free mint, while Golden Ticket holders will receive 2 free mints.\n\nIn addition, special features are available for any batch mints of Gewgaw. Each iteration of a batch mint will allow for the same number of additional views (up to 9).  The same palette and animation styles will be reorganized into a new structure of blocks and can be accessed by using the number keys. For example, a batch of mint of 3 will provide the second work of the batch to have two views which can be switched between using keys 1 and 2.  The third mint of the batch will have three views switchable using keys 1, 2, and 3.", "imageUrl": "https://arweave.net/ja3c8T_g-8w2PaF2CwSj2aaf17tbm7RariK6kq_-TEA"},
