The first lunar calendar, dated to 32,000 BC was discovered, drawn on animal bone in caves. It's believed hunters during the last Ice Age used these portable lunar calendars to anticipate the behavior of different animals like Mammoths. Since then, our Moon has been imprinted across all our ancient and modern cultures, even becoming the system from which our Gregorian calendar evolved from. In the present day, investors in crypto have used the Moon symbolically. \n\nWhat does it mean for all of us in crypto to be so ahead of our time, all while using the same metaphor of the Moon for the various measures of success and individual goals we collectively share in crypto? And how will the future appreciate our ambitions and perseverance within the present moment's growing pains on our way to mass adoption? These are some of the questions that Gazers ask.\n\nOn the surface, Gazers function as a lunar calendar, algorithmically synching closely with Moon phases in the sky, joining the blockchain with one of humanity's longest running lineages in art. Gazers seeks to create a community of collectors celebrating the change of our perceptions that happen over time, our collective goals in crypto, and our love of color theory, astronomy, and generative art. \n\nWhat we are building in blockchain and NFTs will primarily be for the benefit of the future. As such, this artwork was designed to pace itself and speed up its frame rate over time, scaling into anticipated advancements in technology that will steadily allow the artwork to run at faster speeds while at larger scales. Each NFT starts out with the assignment of a date from the past 20 years. These dates correspond to events that happened under particular New Moons that shaped my path as an artist. This is the Origin Moon trait and how Gazers is in part a conceptual self portrait. \n\nStarting from the Origin Moon, each New Moon that arrives will speed up the potential animation of the NFT. For example, an NFT with a 20 year old Origin Moon might run at 20 frames per second, appearing as an animation. But one with an Origin Moon fresh from the sale will run closer to 1 frame per second, appearing more like a slowly evolving painting. Every moment, the frame rate of the artwork speeds up fractionally, indecipherable to our eyes. Stacking these advancements over time creates a generational evolution of experience. There is something undeniably beautiful about everything speeding up within our lifetimes, but the Moon, high above us, continues to carry on at the same meandering rate of 29.53 days in each cycle. Much like these blockchain technologies and NFT markets, this artwork was designed to be collected by the present, but appreciated in a greater sense than we can even imagine by the future. \n\nI created Gazers to be like a living artwork, to be lived with, and to not only have the artwork evolve over time but also the appreciation and experience of viewers. As I coded the work, I imagined it hanging on the wall of collectors, a fixture in their physical space. Collectors might spend a moment admiring their work, walk away for a couple hours, and then come back to be delighted, noticing the most subtle of shifts. Each layer of the work consists of pattern designs. With the passage of time, the thickness of the layered lines pulse and the direction a design moves will advance or rotate, changing our perception of color in the most subtle and optical of ways. Each day at midnight, each layer receives a new set of rules in terms of how to rise or shine over the next 24 hours. The result is color that rises and sets, echoing the change of light in our sky.\n\nMy use of color has consistently been what I've been best known for across my 20 year artistic career. In all my work until now, I've made all the color and design choices as I've painted as a human in the moment. But in Gazers, I designed a complex system around color theory as I understand it, joining my talent for coding with my vision for color. \n\nMany NFT collectors of my work might be familiar with the additional experiences some of their NFTs unlock at my website. Rather than use a Gazers NFT to unlock a website, I decided this time to create rendering modes that unlock within the code over time. These additional modes of viewing are intended to help a collector better understand the architecture of their artwork's design and also benefit from greater enjoyment of it. The addition of these experiences should present an additional benefit to HODLing for some. \n\nEvery 29 and a half days, we reach a Moon phase called the New Moon. This is when the dark side of the Moon is fully visible and no sunlight is reflected from the lunar surface back to Earth. In Gazers, each New Moon phase creates a New Moon design. In this artwork, the hash seed creates color theory and design rules. These rules are deterministic and dictate all the moons that will generatively be created into infinity. Time reveals our moons. Pairing time with deterministic generative code creates the ephemeral moment. We can all agree that looking at the Moon in the sky never seems to be the exact same experience twice, nor the exact same from different locations. I wanted to echo this nature in Gazers and emphasize the urgency and rarity of our present moment and how an artwork can capture this. \n\nAs individuals, we all have our own version of the Moon and what reaching it means. Just as our goals change over time, often subtly, sometimes dramatically, so will our moons, creating a visual representation that might coincide with what's changing inside of us. In crypto, we are all ahead of our time. We are all gazers. And we are all waiting for our next Moon.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pepqUFeetYERaIb1kC9AtXGwvHDQ27ejxY4Y3rrWGh_N9WVepMRe6vBcm-DbMpJxoAfys3Rjb74INOvHl3BQ7f_uXF9_qvqy2A"},

Elements change their relationships - what is out turns in; what is flat deepens.

Some outputs challenge our depth perception conventions, while others manipulate explicit structural cues and emphasize intentional imperfections.\n\nFrom this concept, the piece gets its name - Trichro-matic - denoting the ability to perceive using all three primary colors. The hyphenated \"o-matic\" denotes fictional machinery, hinting at the generative system supporting the piece. Both hand-selected and algorithmically-generated color palettes feature, with the latter aiming to elicit emotions akin to the former.\n\nWhen you explore an output from different starting points, you understand the elements' relationships differently. In these changing interpretations, no answer is definitive. Each perspective, whether your first, your last, or someone else's, is valid.\n\nPrints will be available for Trichro-matic owners.

Snowfro) has been intrigued by the idea of representing digital artwork in the physical world in the form of an ephemeral physical object with meaning, but with no inherent value. \n\nDonald Judd has long been an inspiration for Art Blocks. One aspect we admire most about Judd’s artistic practice is the elegance of design he effortlessly paired with the accessibility of materials that could be found at a hardware store. With Judd as inspiration, we hatched a plan to create a unique generative art friendship bracelet that includes instructions to make, in minutes, a simple bracelet using a few dollars’ worth of embroidery floss. Donald Judd believed that what surrounds us in our day-to-day life is already so beautiful, and that ultimately the experience of creating art is as important as owning it.\n\nErick was incredibly excited to collaborate with renowned artist Alexis André (a.k.a. MacTuitui) to bring generative art and ephemeral physical objects together in the form of friendship bracelets. Conceptualized by Erick and aesthetically and programmatically designed by Alexis, this project pairs creative coding with a beautiful spectrum of embroidery floss colors. The project was a true team effort, as each member of the Art Blocks team designed and named their own color palette!\n\nThe project is a token of our appreciation to the creators, makers, builders, and collectors who have all contributed to making the Art Blocks community what it is today. Participating in this project is a signal, both online and IRL, that you’re a participant in this evolution of art + community. You are pushing the best ideas forward. You are the reason all of these imaginative projects come to life. Our community is what makes all of this possible. So, to say it plainly, we appreciate you, and we hope that you’ll accept this bracelet as a token of our special friendship!\n\nThe owner of any wallet with an Art Blocks piece at the time of snapshot (October 26, 2022, at 3pm US Central time) is eligible to claim two mints from this special generative art project. We would love to see you keep one bracelet and share your love for generative art by gifting your second mint! These mints are free to claim (you pay only the gas) and exist on L1 Ethereum. Please note that we may in the future release additional modified iterations of the Friendship Bracelets project, ideally on an L2 scaling solution, that may substantially increase the total supply of tokens related to the project, with the intent of being a more accessible entry point to a larger audience. But this version is what we're here to celebrate today, and this gift is for you in gratitude for your support along the way.

Bringing together choreography, code, blockchain, generative art, and cryptography, the work culminates in a live performance. Each output is driven by the motion data of its underlying unique, on-chain choreographic sequence. The sequences behind the first 100 minted works (mint #2 to #101) will be performed during the IRL premiere. The hosting art institution will be announced in 2023. \n\nA journey of slowly recovering the human unfolds as such: 1) reveal on Art Blocks, 2) uncover the choreographic score, and 3) final performance. After the reveal, the human is still unreadable, visible only through the results of movement on glass, obfuscated by code, rendered as a still image. In the next phase of the work, collectors get a glimpse at their underlying choreography by unlocking the secondary token—an on-chain choreographic score. In the final phase, the performance, life is breathed into the human movement that has been lying dormant inside the pieces. **Human Unreadable** brings flesh and viscerality into code and \"vulnerability as a feature\" into long-form generative art. What you don’t immediately see in the visual artwork outputs is the invisible potentiality of performance, inscripted on-chain and able to be brought to life by a dancer at any moment. \n\n **Human Unreadable** intentionally punctures the safety of modernist design and the idea of a universal voice, pushing the limits of human expression within rigid technical systems. With a focus on the body, the collection brings risk, chaos, confusion, and vulnerability to the reveal, everything that function-focused design systems normally prevent. Each piece is an invitation, a transparent layer through which the messy human experience can come into focus through the three phases of the work. This work is a continuation of the pivot away from modernism, clean lines, and the quietly gendered values therein, in favor of a more embodied and sensual approach to human-machine collaboration pioneered by early women in digital art. **Human Unreadable**'s 6 distinct looks derive from the core materiality of Operator’s Privacy Collection: glass, light, x-ray and the human body. The transparent and illuminating nature of these materials reveal what is below the surface.\n\nWhat are you revealing when you reveal?\n\n**Human Unreadable** has roots in various histories such as computational choreography (Analivia Cordeiro, Jeanne Beaman), Merce Cunningham's Chance Dance, and the Experiments in Art and Technology movement. With Ti’s extensive background as an HCI technologist and multimedia artist and Catherine’s background as a choreographer and performance artist, Operator architected a bespoke team, 25+ individuals ranging from specialized engineers to dancers, who embarked on a 9 month process to realize the work. Operator's on-chain generative choreography method is the technical backbone of **Human Unreadable**—the process and open source tooling for which will be made available via white paper in 2023.  \n\n\n***Additional Information***\n\n**First Minter Benefits** \nThe first 100 minted pieces (mint #2 to #101) from the collection will be performed in the IRL premiere in an art institution. \n-Mint #2 to #101 will be counted as the first 100 mints. Mint #0 and #1 are artist mints held by Operator.\n-Hosting art institution will be announced in 2023. \n-Additionally, Privacy Key 00 holders will have one of their collected Human Unreadable sequences performed.\n\n**Choreographic Score (secondary token)** \n-The secondary token will be released at the end of June 2023.\n-The secondary token is a choreographic score that represents the unique choreography that generated the output minted on Art Blocks. For this reason, the Art Blocks token and the secondary token are bound together and cannot be transferred separately.\n-The underlying choreographic score visible through the secondary token can be performed by a choreographer or dancer at the collector's discretion.\n\n**GPU Intensive Rendering / Live Preview** \nThis piece involves GPU intensive composition and rendering of programmatically drawn body parts, generative glass objects, x-ray shaders as well as motion paths. As a result the ‘live preview’ on your laptop or phone may look less detailed than the PNG on Art Blocks which is rendered by a high powered computer. Not to worry!\n\n**Official Token-gated Prints** \nHuman Unreadable collectors will be able to purchase Operator official, signed, token-gated prints (on hand-selected materials) of their collected piece(s).", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WhZdpCPxyUOU5HMBjf3WuLfXTUfqVGriBKuurI_cq_XbPUdp3CmpuBknVhQF1m3JP2ZaG7k6RElRjrLXHLklpKD6x3yyfc-rtA"},

Later, when the disks deteriorated and became unreadable or were lost, the data became memories with a deep feeling of loss.\n\nBlockchains have arisen. Are these truly persistent?\n\nAfter all, digital data are also a type of memories. They are stored in a person's mind, deteriorate, and one day will be lost with that person.\n\nI find the fragility and beauty in them.\n　\n\n\n\n\n\n　\nIn this work, I attempted to represent a fictional collapsed blockchain world with visuals and sound.\n　\nThe chain has already been abandoned, and the few nodes that remain barely alive are just maintaining their appearances. Visualizing the remnants of blocks that no longer serve their original purpose, they form something like a submerged city. Then, a large amount of data that has lost its connection to the blocks and has deteriorated to the point that it can no longer be opened, flutters through the sky. The countless remnants of data form a cloud, which undulates like a wave. The details of the data cannot be confirmed, however, they can be seen as glittering lights. As I try to recall the contents of the data that can no longer be opened, I am filled with vague memories and a sense of nostalgia.\n\nThis work started with generating sound by code. The sound of rippling waves can be heard by clicking on the screen. Since it would be impractical to store huge sound data on the blockchain, the sound was formed from white noise. In order to reproduce the sound of rippling waves, it was necessary to deepen my understanding of the structure of the sound by referring to academic papers. Then the sound was completed, and the visual imagination expanded from there.\n\nI like to visit the sea near my home and in other places. Different seascapes can be seen from different locations and angles. When I am there, idly gazing at the seascape and listening to the sound of the waves, I sometimes feel as if I am the only human there and the world has gone to ruin. If the world were ruined, this seascape and the sound of the waves would remain for a long time. This feeling and the fragility felt in digital data are the basis of this work. I imagine that the heaven or the graveyard where the lost data flies up in the sky and arrives may be a seascape like this.\n\nThe reason why I used data as lights and clouds drifting in the sky and moved them like waves is because I wanted to depict unrealistic behavior with a realistic subject matter and to express a beautiful and bizarre world in which these intertwine.\n\nFor the visual expression technique, I further pursued and evolved the drawing system that I have developed in \"GHOST IN THE CODE\" and my other works. Everything is composed of rectangles, indicating that this world is beginning to become low-resolution. Depth is linked to the size of the rectangles, and distant objects are represented by small rectangles as if they were in focus. Dispersion in the position and color of the rectangles indicate the degree of deterioration of the world. Moreover, the sky, blocks, and the surface of the water are identified and each has its own characteristics.\n\nAlgorithms generate various compositions, colors, and other features. I have attempted to make each output feel nostalgic and fresh at the same time. The blocks, which have lost their original meaning, are contrasted with the data, which exists in isolation from them, in stillness and movement. Occasional red clouds or blocks mean that they are corrected as red, the first color, due to missing information.\n\nThrough these integrations, I have attempted to create a work that can be stored on a blockchain, and that is both visually and sonically interactive.\n\n[NOTE]\n\n-To save the image press the 'S' key.\n-To change the flow velocity press the '↑' or '↓' key.\n\nModern hardware and browser hardware acceleration is recommended.

Little now is known of that time, other than that it reshaped the earth and brought magic into the world. The time of the Singularity was brought to an end by a cataclysm known as the Schism, an event that separated magic from the Runiverse, sending it to a realm called the Elsewhere, and with it, the wizards of the Singularity. For many centuries following the Schism, all seemed well; humanity moved on and some remnants of magic remained to aid in the rebuilding of society. \n\nBut all was not well. Something was growing along the edge of reality, eating away the Runiverse, bit by bit, a plague known as the Absence; a creeping fog that swallowed not just the land, but all memory of what was once there.\n\nNow, the world is on the brink. The Absence has nearly swallowed the whole of the physical Runiverse. Nearly all has been forgotten. What is remembered is fragmented and unreliable. But there is still hope.\n\nWith a little help from the few remaining mages in the physical world, a window from the Elsewhere has become a door to the Runiverse. The wizards of the past who were once banished must return magic to the world in order to restore the memory of what was, and push back the Absence.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/s/raw/files/10772e31e9dba89aa7dc6c12c105fe25.gif?w=500&auto=format"},

It is inspired by the aesthetics inherent in screen printing along with the compositions and colors of both Bauhaus, Constructivism, and pulp fiction sci-fi covers.\n\nThe compositions in \"Screens\" is based purely on strict geometries and plays with the tension, and symphonies that can be created from combining simple rules. The end result can range from chaotic non-figurative to strongly ordered isometric scenes.\n\nThe generative system underlying the rendering mimics the screen printing process by rendering and applying a single color at a time to a master image. Each virtual screen may be more or less aligned with the master, creating a lovely flawed balance to the precision of the rendered geometry.\n\n25% of the proceeds from this project will be donated to Den Blå Planet, The Danish National Aquarium, in support of their work on preserving and restoring marine life and ecology.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/n2xsI88RBBV8vxkQVvBlfO_4EVey3097-pgK29Oid-Id7aOGZrwE1qvi6eZBjiwrSfYEFTEsjvr_OXwDOkeBc_f_4EhnRFUVKg"},

Whether encapsulated in physical or computational techniques, these processes act with their own degree of autonomy from our own biases and as a result, open up new ideas and sensibilities while dismantling traditional notions of authorship. They allow one to code the possibility of discovery and surprise into the creative process in a manner that can be widely shared and because of this transmissibility, algorithms frustrate the idea of a single author, inviting speculation on the shared nature of creativity. For this reason we have always understood our work to be a collaboration between each other, those who share with us and those who inspire us. \n\nOver the years, the studio has indulged in a number of obsessions. One is the conviction that history is a generative source with which to constantly entangle. Whether it is through stories, characters, techniques, or events, history acts as a medium active with properties that constantly reshape and transform our concept of the present. We look back to move forward, like hitching a ride. It is here that we encounter Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528) and his masterpiece Melancholia I (1514) to inspire a deep dive into the process of engraving as a representational technique reinterpreted through the contemporary medium of code. By scratching metal away from a plate, an inversion of conventional drawing, engraving allowed a work of art to be reproduced and disseminated widely. In addition to the piece’s masterful delineation, its allegory resonates with us as well. In Dürer’s time melancholy was associated with insanity but also with creativity. In the engraving, the winged personification of melancholy -- the work is widely regarded to be a self-portrait of the artist -- is surrounded by the tools and elements of geometry. For Dürer, as for a handful of others who came before and after, who test the porous borders between art, science and religion, geometry is a vehicle for imagination, a shadow of the divine and a portal to the infinite. \n\nThis work Primitives is a kindred meditation on infinity through an exploration of a novel geometric structure using algorithm and code, the tools of today's geometers and mystics, made visible through the anachronism of the engravers trade translated into pure 1’s and 0’s. Primitives grows through a single shape that can repeat and scale in specific ways that are never random, but rather tightly governed by geometric logics. It is about drawing infinity through a radical modularity; ordered but aperiodic. Unlike a regular crystal, whose molecular pattern is periodic (or repetitive in all directions), the distinctive quality of this quasicrystal is that its structural pattern never repeats the same way twice. Endless and uneven in aggregate, Primitive clusters can be described by the precise arrangement of a single modular part. As these small units aggregate together they form larger figures that themselves combine into ever larger movements, always a little bit different from any other. In this sense, quasicrystalline patterns have an infinite capacity to create and carry information. \n\nWe are here because this is a medium for sharing in perpetuity. In the last couple of years, on the cusp of our third decade of practice, we have watched with awe and delight a renaissance in generative work as it's adopted by an entirely new generation around blockchain technologies. This inspired us to enter this new space with our own enduring questions of form and geometry, modularity and variability, historical continuity, and the thirst for endlessness. Primitives is what we selected as our primer into generative art on-chain because both the work and the medium grapple with these questions. \n\nSome Notes:\nOn the screen, Primitives is represented as a two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional figure. Each invocation comes with a sequence of projections, or rotations, around this object. As Primitives spins, there are moments when its blocks snap into alignment with other blocks  revealing its underlying lattice and crystalline nature. Each projection can be saved as a high resolution image for printing. Primitives can also be saved in three dimensions as an .obj file for a variety of uses including the creation of a physical object through 3-d printing or fabrication.

Taking DRIFT’s widely exhibited Meadow installation as a point of departure, Schema comprises 300 unique, generative, and animated artworks uniting DRIFT and Davis’s artistic visions. \n\nThis collaborative new project is inspired by the beauty and simplicity of DRIFT’s two-dimensional schematic designs for Meadow, an upside-down landscape in which illuminated mechanical flowers open and close as part of a poetic choreography. Hung from a ceiling, this mesmeric work examines the impermanence of the changing seasons and the phenomenology of nature.\n\nAt its core, Schema is a love letter to the preliminary work that goes into realizing any large-scale art installation—in this case, diagram-making. Together, Gordijn, Nauta, and Davis developed a custom algorithm that brings the physical sculpture’s details and idiosyncrasies to life, recasting its diagrammatic origins in four possible styles: Diagram, the style that most closely resembles DRIFT’s preliminary diagrams for Meadow; Color Study, which strips out the structural elements of the diagrams and express the flowers as abstract rings of color; Sketch, which renders the flowers as line drawings with chalk-like accents; and Blueprint, which resembles the style of a blueprint.\n\nIn addition to these four different drawing styles, the project’s algorithmic system chooses two parent colors for each artwork, which may result in a wide spectrum of colors appearing across the composition from left to right or, alternatively, a more monochromatic scheme. The flowers themselves also have their own color systems that determine the relationship between their physical color and the color of their internal lights, creating gradient effects as the cast light blends with the local color. \n\nVariable traits in any given Schema artwork also include: the total number and location of the flowers; day and night modes that impact ambient light effects; each flower’s apparent position relative to the viewer; and the frequency and speed at which each flower opens and closes. Flowers in these artworks also run on their own cycles, deliberately avoiding synchronization and giving the whole scene a sense of organic motion. Once the viewer clicks on a static Schema composition to activate its motion, the animations in the artwork evolve endlessly.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fRAUPcuSJfUeIxispz1D3s_e2avppgmabGKPaqprGBU8Y9DvlknPIMkTNnKZDl7Uq6eFYvKNcb2BIrBzLUqAS7G0wLVF5K-nH_7F"},

The illness is in my family and in that of close friends of mine, and this work is more of a raw expression of emotion than anything else. Holding hands with a person who is fading away is a strong experience, one that allows oneself to recalibrate and to, in a way, regenerate one's vision of what life is, what a person is, what relationships are. It's commonplace to hear that a loved one who is already gone is still alive \"in our memory\". The truth is that this is the case when we are all alive and good as well, but only take notice when there is a crossing over event. We don't see the person almost anymore, but there's a body there that sometimes still reacts. How much of what we ignore that is going on is relevant? Is this song we just played relevant? What do emotions look like when the brain that processes them is failing? Are we ready to understand those, with our limited knowledge of what we are? Is the person still there when there is no sign of them? And when they are not there, why can we not cut the cord? The simple touch of their skin is enough to make the person come alive in that instant in our very memories. Maybe we are in theirs, in that moment, in a shape we don't comprehend.\n\nVisually, the project merely projects faces. Fading, waving. Unstable, some smiling, some sad. A diversity of lives emerges in the piece, exploring with generative techniques the emotions of you, the experiencer of the piece. Maybe it does not resonate with you, but maybe it gives you a chance to connect with those feelings that are otherwise hard to get close to. We see a person and their dreams, their ideas, their memories as dancing colorful geometries. Their fears, ther recurring thoughts. But sometimes they look like a nightmare. Sometimes they are mute. We see some lines where the faces are enclosed. These are a template for a human, the lines that dictate where our facial features should be. But they dance with the memories as time passes by - is our notion of human also a moving target? Sometimes you will see more than one face, an expression of the many lives we might have lived. And at any time, we can summon a view of the piece where we see you in me. _You in me_.\n\nAllowing ourselves to be a companion of someone else's difficult passage is a window into our own humanity. An occasion for regeneration.\n\nWorks best on Chromium browsers. Firefox macos has some problem with geometries drawn with p5.js in webGL mode.

The first element within the sculpture, akin to a black hole, is a shape that defines itself through the surrounding characteristics it draws in. This halo of characteristics, like a beautifully radiant glass cover, symbolizes the constructed personality. Casting light on these black shapes, shielded by the identities they exhibit, the algorithm invites us to question our perceptions of those we encounter. How deeply do we truly know the people in our lives? It challenges us to consider if changing the perspective could alter our perception of them, while also offering the opportunity to simulate such a change with the help of animation. Perhaps the nature of our identities is as varied as the angles from which they are viewed?\n\nBlind Spots serves as a depiction of my mental journey, transforming abstract thought patterns into a solidified artifact in the medium of generative art. The narrative is inspired by the diverse ways in which we perceive each other, a theme born from countless personal encounters. From a technical standpoint, it steps into uncharted territory for me, being the first artwork to emphasize high-resolution printing capabilities while maintaining real-time animation, a central element in my artwork. It is also my first on-chain project, prompting a restructure of the previous workflows.\n\nVisually inspired by *Iittala - Kaleidoscope* exhibition, which displayed a mesmerizing interplay of glass sculptures and light, Blind Spots features a gradient backdrop punctuated by black shapes that undulate under the influence of a transmission shader, mimicking the iridescent shimmer of pearls. The geometry of the glass cover is crafted through the algorithmic movement of two curves revolving around each other. To produce high-resolution images suitable for printing, a bucket rendering technique with overscan was developed.\n\nArticulated through two elements within each portrait, Blind Spots presents a visual metaphor for a human. This duality also echoes our presence on social media — carefully crafted showcases projecting a polished persona while concealing the authentic self. Together, the elements form a unique character from every point of view.\n\n## Controls\n- [ click ] - toggle animation\n- [ s ] - save the current frame as an image\n\n## URL parameters (see display notes)\n- [ ?animate ] - animation on by default\n- [ ?fill ] - responsive version to fill the browse\n- [ ?width=x ] - render image with x width\n- [ ?print ] - enable high-resolution mode (eg. ?print&width=10000)\n- [ ?grainSamples=x ] - between 1 - 10\n- [ ?refractSamples=x ] - between 1 - 5", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/A9fyBvVH5eCauaHFhR5prBn66IOlU7ZCeV2gRfg859erwxTzr_GEgmHB2hcKwG6OJBxjT7Cr0ayhxmrsieQsiW637aVwrPNT-a4"},

The work is informed by notions of choreography, modular pattern composition and character design.\n\nKubikino is an idiosyncratic face, made of a combination of graphical elements and colours generated by code. Using an essential library of geometries - all deriving from the circle - and primary tones, the code randomly creates new faces resembling human physiognomy, animals and traditional masks.\n\nThrough the deliberate reference to a face, Kubikino prompts contemplation on the traditional notions of identity, similarity, and persona, as well as the ongoing need to establish one's own representation within a community - from traditional masks to digital avatars. For centuries, human identity has been a source of cultural fascination, with the word \"identity\" stemming from the Latin term \"identitas,\" signifying both \"sameness\" and “oneness.”\n\nInspired by Bruno Munari's \"Faces,\" a collection of abstract portraits created using basic geometric shapes and lines, Kubikino reflects on the simplicity, playfulness, and power of design to communicate across cultures and generations.\n\nDrawing upon the influential dance theories of Rudolf Laban and Merce Cunningham, Kubikino's device process for the creation of its faces is underpinned by a sophisticated framework of modular pattern composition. The project's generated output is organised into a grid-based structure, where each section corresponds to a phrase, and the relationship between the various sections collectively generates the final composition. Referencing Laban’s Movement Analysis, each section is paraphrasing LMA's four key components: body (loop), shape (direction), dynamic (colour), space (relationship within the space).\n\nKubikino also adopts the principles of \"chance\" and \"structured improvisation\" articulated by avant-garde pioneers John Cage and Merce Cunningham in the 1960s. The Kubikino identity is constructed from a selected array of animated graphics, rules, and paradigms that correspond to motifs, scores, and ensembles found in conventional art forms such as dance, music, and paintings.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0EPFQylMQRrbBLcecP0RNlz1nzK87KJykhImlzbPqszoYW9fEDcU4fXL3YW9a6_54D36pmIzsH8AnCSudBHI3MvUcdk0uO3WgNg"},

They are used widely in architecture, product design, and perhaps most familiarly in user interfaces. Think: desktop icons like trash cans or notepads. SKEUOMORPHS is a meditation on this digital tradition. \n\nSKEUOMORPHS picks up where RASTER left off as an another exploration of the materiality of pixels and rasterized imagery. Here the study of pixels narrows in on the shallow depth of on-screen interfaces and the play of low-res figure-ground effects. Moments of skeuomorphism where the 2-dimensional plane of the screen becomes slightly 3-dimensional through beveling or drop-shadows are extracted and used as abstract painterly details. These elements that are typically used to make computation and interfaces more familiar become unfamiliar on the canvas, suggesting the possibility of an aesthetic between abstraction and realism.\n\nSKEUOMORPHS employs recurring themes and techniques from my art practice: limited color palettes, low-res chunky pixels, dithering, and physics simulation. It uses a specific kind of dithering called R-sequence dither developed by Martin Roberts. Like traditional Bayer matrix-based dithering, this technique produces a patterned image akin to retro video games and early computer screens. In this project, the R-dither pattern results in a woven textile-like texture, which recalls the long relationship between computing and weaving. The canvas negotiates two scales simultaneously: that of the dithered pixel (rendered at 1/1024th of the canvas height) and the simulated particle that acts as a brush stroke (rendered at 1/256th of the canvas height). The two resolutions work together to produce a cohesive texture that is neither pretending to be a retrograde screen nor an analog material but something in between. Similar to RASTER, the goal is to investigate new avenues for digital aesthetics that rely on a combination of historical techniques and innovative practices.\n\nUse mouse or touch controls to interact.\nPress 's' to grab a still frame.\n\nCollectors will be eligible to receive a signed archival giclée print of their mint.", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2KwF-XnOMvzoC83O9HFJ48h5z0TlCaRJ33raDUPX47a58rw4AdHucVJJjX5k2GVC3HbfadtTndcWbXxGLTo2L5g8o-RByKG3Gg"},

We shot for 1 hour, no break, a staccato of poses and expressions, before his girlfriend came to pick him up for a Halloween Party.

Each neuron has a nucleus at its source and fires electrical signals searching for synaptic connections. \n\nThe signals, or in this case, pixels, act in accordance with the current mental state, which periodically enters states of stress, awareness, re-centering, reprogramming, and more.\n\nThe work explores the brain’s ability to change its synaptic pathways, materializing our cognitive flexibility and rigidity, inviting us to consider what barriers prohibit growth and positive change.  **Axo** is part observation of my own mental state and part research, analysis, and reflection. \n\nWe are all a node on the societal network. The effects of our individual state ripple out impacting the network as a whole. As such, each **Axo** can be connected with and influence other works in the collection. Awareness can spread and evolve the network, or stress can cause chaos.  \n\n**Axo** opens a dialogue on personal growth and societal change at the intersection of cognitive science, art, and technology, inviting us to envision a better existence and a harmonious network, underlining that this utopia is only a shift in perspective away. \n\n**Axo** is fully responsive & built using my pixel-easing algorithm.

Each year, trees add a new ring to their trunks, recording their growth and responding to the changing seasons and environmental conditions. These rings tell a story of the tree's life. By replicating these patterns, the project captures the rhythmic and organic qualities of nature.\n\nIn this project, I wanted to explore the aesthetic and conceptual possibilities of tree rings through code-based art. I used a generative algorithm to simulate the growth of virtual trees, generating patterns that resemble the annual rings of real trees, but with a twist. Instead of using traditional circular or oval shapes, I experimented with different geometric forms and noise. I also played with colors and instead of using earthy and realistic colours, the palettes are inspired by the richness and diversity of the natural world.\n\nThe algorithm works by starting with the outer most ring, which over time grows towards an arbitrary chose center according to certain rules and parameters. Each iteration adds a new layer of shapes inside the previous one, mimicking the accumulation of tree rings. I introduced random mutations and variations, which introduce unexpected and unpredictable outputs, evoking the unpredictability of natural processes.\n\nEach artwork is inviting the viewer to contemplate the complexity and diversity of nature. I hope that this project will inspire others to explore the wonders of nature and to experiment with code-based art as a means of expression and exploration.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/62be5f1e594a61d0fbc7414d425b16a2.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

Beyond technology ::**\n\nImagine a world where technology not only advances mechanically, but also adapts and changes in response to its environment. \n\nIn this view, machines could evolve into a variety of forms, from biological and organic to architectural and industrial, each with its own unique capabilities and characteristics.\n\nThe UMK algorithm could be thought of as a life form that has evolved from a seed. Its DNA defines the way in which it grows and develops.\n\n**:: Motivation ::**\n\nUMK expands my previous explorations of the interaction between humans and technology. \n\nPreviously, In the \"Defrag Trilogy\" (link in the website), I narrate a tale spanning three chapters, exploring the emotions we encounter as we mature amidst a technologically world. The conclusion: technology emerges victorious every time.\n\nThis time, I delve into the idea of a world where human intervention is not necessary, showcasing a hypothetical scenario where machines operate and evolve independently. What would self-evolving technology look like?\n\n**:: Aesthetics ::**\n\nAs a devout admirer of Manga and graphic novels, the style of the artwork is centered around creating a hand-drawn, captivating one-page masterpiece. \n\nWith UMK, I embark on a journey of maximalist illustration. A path that pushes the boundaries of my previous creations to achieve  figurative pieces that are both visually stunning and unpredictably intriguing.\n \nThis maximalist approach is designed to evoke a sense of wonder and exploration. The intricate use of textures and interlocking geometries invites the viewer to dive into the artwork and be entranced by the details and nuances. \n\n**:: Animation ::**\n\nAnimation is crafted to captivate and hold the viewer's attention. Sit back and savor the mesmerizing construction mechanics and the gentle flow of the subtle elements in the background.\n\n**:: Final words ::**\n\nIn UMK there is a touch of the clean and dreamlike drawing of Jean Giraud (Moebius), the intricate technological structures of Katsuhiro Otomo, or the biomechanical orgies of H.R. Giger. These are some examples of artists who have left a lasting impression on me and whose works continue to shape my aesthetic sensibility.\n\nArt lies within the code itself. When we view the outcome on the screen, we are witnessing the crystallization of the algorithm at a specific moment, under certain conditions. The code is immutable and the results are mere coincidence. \n\nEnjoy UMK.\n\n**:: Interaction ::**\n\nYou can restart the animation or save it as a hi resolution PNG image.\nTap the screen or mouse click to show the reset/save buttons.\nAlso you can use keys: 'S' to save , 'R' to restart", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5SKrVedRtuZdIku3hHJHqqz1exrGzRi_uvTYHdoc3L4YGWgGF6isAXFe_exkriUN2Bz8ennrdjX9OZpbBXpHf1yYlQttevPXsS4"},

Both contemplation and meditation have proven to have a positive impact on improving mental and physical health.  \n\nConsciousness, Healing arts, and spirituality, Fushi No Reality is a window through surrealities. A procedural immortal healing ritual unlocking our capacity to cure ourselves.  \n\nEach surreality is forged from a real-time organic system running in an infinite and perpetual movement, crafted from chaos and noise-domain explorations. From a computing point of view, there is no distinction between visually random noise and mastered noise. They are both an output of the same algorithm perceived by our brain as a signal. From a soul point of view, the difference is the perception and what we, humans, do qualify as pleasing, perceptible, or intriguing.\n\nExploration, observation, and modulation are key to this vast pandemonium of chaos. A creative process to re-forge shapes we already observe in our world’s best inspiration: Nature.\n\nThis inspiration directed Fushi No reality towards Landscape art/cloth art mixed with vaporware aesthetics, slow movement, and peaceful color palettes.  A light beam travels through each surreality to guide a few voyaging spirits across the landscape. Portrait or landscape,  the surrealities are meant to be displayed in both ways, viewers may look at generative cloth swirling and sci-fi planetary landscapes.  \n\nThe more adventurous may move their cursor to the top or bottom to live a faster healing experience.\n\nNo one can bring you peace but yourself, but this time, let’s travel together.\n\nフシハ、セイカツノナカデスローダウンスルテダスケガヒツヨウカモシレナイヒト、シコウ二マヨッテシマウヒト、タチアガルタメノフォーカスポイントガヒツヨウナヒトノタメノシュウチュウリョクガクシュウデス。\n\n[Fushi no reality / フシノゲンジツ]ハ、シサクへノショウタイジョウデス。\nワタシタチノカンジョウレベルヲサポートスルヤクワリヲハタシ、メイソウジョウタイヘトミチビクコトデ、ワタシタチノカンキョウヲヨリイイモノ二スルコトヲモクテキトシテイマス。メイソウトジュクコウハドチラモ、シンシンノケンコウゾウシン二イイエイキョウヲアタエルコトガショウメイサレテイマス。\n\nイシキ、ヒーリングアート、スピリチュアリティ、フシギノリアリティハチョウゲンジツヲトウシテノマドデス。フメツノイヤシノギシキハ、ワタシタチジシンノチユノウリョクヲトキハナツタメノテズクリデス。\n \nソレゾレノチョウゲンジツハ、カオストノイズリョウイキノタンキュカラツクラレタ、ムゲンカツエイゾクテキナハタラキデハタラクリアルタイムノユウキテキナシステムカラツクラレテイマス。コンピューティングノカンテンカラハ、シカクテキ二ランダムナノイズトマスタリングサレタノイズノアイダニクベツハナイ。ドチラモ、ワタシタチノノウガシンゴウトシテニンシキスルオナジアルゴリズムノシュツリョクデアル。タマシイノカンテンカラハ、ソノチガイハチカクノチガイデアリ、ワタシタチニンゲンガナニヲモッテ「タノシイ」「チカクデキル」「キョウミヲソソラレル」トハンダンスルカトイウコトデス。\n\nコノコウダイナカオスノパンデモニウム二ハ、タンサク、カンサツ、ソシテモジュレーションガジュウヨウナカギトナリマス。コノセカイサイコウノインスピレーションノナカデ、ワタシタチガスデニカンサツシテルカタチヲサイケイセイスルタメノソウゾウテキナプロセス。シゼン。\n\nコノインスピレーションハ、[Fushi no reality / フシノゲンジツ]ヲ、ジョウキセンノビガク、ユックリトシタハタラキ、オダヤカナシキチョウヲマゼタフウケイガヤクロスアートニムカワセマシタ。コウセンハソレゾレノチョウゲンジツヲトオリヌケ、フウケイヲヨコギルスウジンノコウカイタマシイヲミチビキマス。ポートレートヤフウケイナド、チョウゲンジツハリョウホウノホウホウデテンジサレルコトヲイトシテアリ、カンショウシャハジェネレーティブナヌノノウズマキヤSFテキナワクセイノフウケイヲナガメルコトガデキマス。\n\nヨリボウケンテキナヒトハ、カーソルノウエカシタカニハタラカシテ、ヨリハヤイイヤシノタイケンヲスルコトモデキマス。\nヘイワヲモタラスノハジブンジシンダケデスガ、コンカイハイッショニタビヲシテミマショウ。", "imageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EryURhZJmiPjV6-s--np__2JSBmuJyyTwiQocrQJwMrwl5GBVtjewczyj7OT00nOiYxTa8g4gttRcBTXtu5a6PCc76OGcLf8Lg"},

The project tells a story of the tragic end of all existence in a distant universe, long since forgotten. Any given individual output depicts a passing moment, captured during the final breath of each dying world. The once peaceful landscapes were torn apart, deforming and reshaping their natural geometries and thus the reality itself in a surrealistic fashion.\n\nEach image is drawn to vaguely mimic a pencil-like texture. Firstly to remind of something familiar and subsequently emitting a peculiar and eerie feeling. Did this event happen and was it witnessed by a carbon-based life-form?\n\nThe project invites the viewer to ponder the different scenarios of what might have transpired in the past that lead the universe to its doom. Although one interpretation can be deciphered from the partially corrupted transmission below, it is not necessarily the true explanation.\n\n\nThe only thing that is known, is that all life ceased to exist in this ancient universe long time ago. Its tale lives on, but only as a memory and as a reminder to us all that life can be fragile and fleeting, albeit beautiful and precious.\n\n## The Story\n\n*”If anyone listens .. …. recording …. ….. ….. .. a warning …. …. will happen .. your world. We didn’t …. …. .. our universe, ……. we drained … ….. resource ….. .. couldn’t sustain … life …. any longer. The great collapse .. moments away … this will .. … end .. our story. Do not …… our mistakes. Most importantly … …. prevent ….. …. ……… ….. world .. … ……. ……… at any cost. This is our final transmission.”*\n\nJust as the transmission ends, a sudden flash of dreamlike images flashes through your mind, leaving a vivid imprint. These were the final moments of an ancient, distant and long forgotten universe. The rush is too much to handle and you faint. You wake up and immediately start looking for the recording but it's gone. You remember everything as clear as day, but was it just a dream?\n\n## The Details\n\nThere are several main scenes, which depict the specific stage that the end has advanced to. The predominantly or entirely black and white and the muted palettes give a sense of silence and solitude. Meanwhile other palettes disturb that calmness. Some palettes remind of colors in nature, but most are chosen and used in unnatural manner touching the style of expressionism.\n\nPressing \"s\" saves a screenshot at any point during the rendering. Pressing \"p\" pauses and unpauses the rendering. Pressing up or down arrow increases or decreases the drawing animation speed.", "imageUrl": "https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/7c5741f4c487aae381bba2a2e1f11923.png?auto=format&w=3840"},

I couldn’t shake the dream, after cold cell walls and nights spent curled up on dirty cell floors, after the touch of an officer's gun to the back of my skull, I was still here.

The piece revolves around the idea of duality. It's both serious and childish. It plays on the contrast between the very crowded slum and the emptiness of the void it seems to float in. Bidonville talks about life and death, and the promiscuity between both in those wild and teeming areas.

FOCUS outputs span three responsive aspect ratios, each of which have three possibilities for the central shape - or focus. Drawing inspiration from the Zen art tradition of doing more with less, the limited palette consists of black, white, and five colors. This palette both constrains possible outcomes and allows the creation of unique perceptual interactions. Except in extremely rare scenarios, each piece can provide a wide variety of visual experiences through its interactive features: use up and down arrows to adjust the pattern recursion factor, left and right arrows to adjust the midpoint count, ‘h’ to hide or show the central shape, and ‘s’ to save.\n\nAs a gift to my collectors, FOCUS has a free-to-claim, 100% on-chain, generative SVG companion project called [deFOCUSed](https://matto.xyz/project/defocused/).

Who are they? Will their fall or race ever end? Where is the finish line?

On this never-ending fall, passing by one or many universes revolving around them, he contemplates all the positive and negative outcomes, dreaming of their parallels eventually meeting:\n\n“In this alternation of hopes and apprehensions, I continued to fall, constantly peering into the depths of space to see if anything heralded an immediate or future change in our condition. A couple of times I managed to glimpse a universe, but it was far away and seemed very tiny, well off to the right or to the left; I barely had time to make out a certain number of galaxies like shining little dots collected into superimposed masses which revolved with a faint buzz, when everything would vanish as it had appeared, upwards or to one side, so that I began to suspect it had only been a momentary glare in my eyes.\n\n […] unwound in continuous, parallel, straight lines which mean nothing beyond themselves in their constant flow, never meeting, just as we never meet in our constant fall […]”\n\nTo all on unknown latitudes, exploring forms of the space.\n\n-------------\nControls: \n\n[p] key or click/tap for pause/play animation\n\n[a] turn auto rotate on/off\n\n[n] rotate view clockwise\n\n\n-------------\nMade with p5.js and chroma.js. \n\n-------------\nMinting 3 tokens at a time will generate a series of Latitudes in all 3 possible directions in the same color palette. \n\n\n\n\n", "imageUrl": "https://arweave.net/ccG1ZTwT6OA07taSQVzFRZoPTr8XRPJRs68aX4T1NWE"},

This means you can keep it, trade it, sell it, or use it on Reddit as your avatar, where Collectible Avatar owners get a special profile treatment that makes them stand out.\n\n[Learn More About Collectible Avatars on Reddit](https://reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/6213835889044).\n\n[View the Previews Terms](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/previews-terms).", "imageUrl": "https://i.redd.it/snoovatar/avatars/contract/01GYB69XQK20FNWERDCX8SMNBN.png"},
